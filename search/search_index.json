The system is designed in a extendable way, with a central data logger (the Data Board ) with network connectivity to which the different components are branched. The system is based on the principle of reproducibility, also integrating non-hardware components such as a dedicated Storage platform and a Sensor analysis framework . On top of that, the system is meant to serve as a base solution for more complex settings , not only related with air quality monitoring. For that purpose, in addition to the Urban Board , the system also provides off-the-shelf support for a wide variety of third party sensors, using the expansion bus as a common port. One example is what we call the Smart Citizen Station : a full solution for low cost air pollution monitoring. The sensors Have a look a the supported sensors in the Firmware ! Measurements \u00b6 All the Smart Citizen Kit new sensors generation measure at least air temperature, relative humidity, noise level, ambient light, barometric pressure and particulate matter (PM). SCK 2.1 \u00b6 Here is the table summarising the sensors: Measurement Units Sensors Air temperature \u00baC Sensirion SHT-31 Relative Humidity % REL Sensirion SHT-31 Noise level dBA Invensense ICS-434342 Ambient light Lux Rohm BH1721FVC Barometric pressure Pa NXP MPL3115A26 Equivalent Carbon Dioxide ppm AMS CCS811 Volatile Organic Compounds ppb AMS CCS811 Particulate Matter PM 1 / 2.5 / 10 \u00b5g/m3 Planttower PMS 5003 Sensor performance Make sure you visit the sensor performance page for further information about the sensors. Installation instructions \u00b6 The sensor comes mounted and almost ready to be used: The first step is to connect the battery. The kit will light in red (configuration mode) and we will be able to configure it by following the instructions at start.smartcitizen.me . After the configuration process, data will be available on the SmartCitizen platform. You can explore the data there or download it using the CSV Download option (guide here ) Power management \u00b6 Battery duration \u00b6 The SCK comes with a 2000mAh LiPo battery. The battery is meant to be a complete power option for short-term measurements and a backup solution when the kit it is used for long periods. For long exposures, we recommend to permanently connect the USB to kit. The battery duration is dependent on which sensors are enabled or disabled: All sensors publishing over Wi-Fi: 12 hrs. All sensors publishing on SD card: 13 hrs. Without air quality sensors over Wi-Fi: 10 days Without air quality sensors on SD card: 25 days You will note that the kit turns itself off while operating on battery. Actually, this is what we call sleep-mode , an operation mode implemented to reduce consumption while on battery operation. Battery calculator \u00b6 You can use the battery calculator to estimate how much your battery would last SCK Battery Calculator What's the SCK's Shell? Learn how to use the powerful SCK Shell. Check the guide . fetch('https://api.github.com/repos/fablabbcn/smartcitizen-tools/contents/calculator.htm') .then(function(response) { return response.json(); }).then(function(data) { var iframe = document.getElementById('github-iframe'); iframe.src = 'data:text/html;base64,' + encodeURIComponent(data['content']); }); Battery charging \u00b6 The SCK has a micro USB port and can be charged like any Smartphone or Tablet using a dedicated adapter or a computer USB port. We recommend using a tablet power adaptor, instead of a computer USB port, for quicker charging. Autonomy can be extended by using a Power Bank, or a 5V PV Panel. Power Supply \u00b6 The SCK needs 5V input via the micro USB connector. A normal 5V power charger can be used, although for outdoor developments we recommend using a waterproof power supply. Find more info in the power supply section . User feedback \u00b6 The LED serves as an indication of the battery status. If the LED is flashing orange it indicates that the battery must be charged. The battery takes about 4 hours to fully charge. When the battery is fully charged, the LED will change from orange to green . Remember that in addition to these colors you will have the state color of the kit: configuration, network and sd. More details Find more details under the data board section User interfaces \u00b6 The data board features a set of user interfaces which provide feedback to the user, as well as two buttons with different functionalities. The main RGB LED provides general feedback of the data board status. Additionally, two buttons are provided for user action. A hardware reset button, which forces a power cut to the board, and a power button, used to change the device's mode, turn on and off the device, and to perform a factory reset. You can see both buttons below: The button \u00b6 The main button interaction is detailed below: Function Button action ON Push the button OFF Push the button for 5 seconds CHANGE MODE Push the button multiple times to choose: Setup Wi-Fi Pink FACTORY RESET Push the button 15 seconds for a full reset An example is shown below: Troubleshooting Have a look at the troubleshoothing section to check how you can use the buttons in case of problems with your SCK! Operation modes \u00b6 Setup mode \u00b6 In this mode, the Kit is ready to be configured in network mode or SD card in start.smartcitizen.me .

But, it does not support WPA/WPA2 Enterprise networks such as EDUROAM or networks with captive portals such as those found in Airports and Hotels SD card mode (offline) \u00b6 If we do not have an internet connection we can use the SD mode. In this case the device will record the data on the micro SD card. Later we can read the card using a card reader. The data can be visually spaced in a spreadsheet but also published on the smartcitizen.me platform using the UPLOAD CSV option.

The files in the sdcard have the following naming: YYYY-MM-DD.CSV, however, you will find in the some extra files (.01, .02...) These are data files that the sensor creates once there is a reset and, to avoid corruption, it creates a new file in the sd-card, by changing the file-extension. A reset takes place every night at 3-4am with the purpose to avoid data loss because a problem. The SCK then stores the data in a file with a sequential name, and does so by changing the filename to YYYY-MM-DD.01, .02\u2026 etc depending on the amount of resets it sees during that day. You can see the data and work with it by changing the name from YYYY-MM-DD.01 to YYYY-MM-DD_01.CSV. Check the guide on how to organise your data to automatise this.

This is probably our best first try once the kit has any problem. You can see it here: Some issues this might help solving: The kit hasn't been posting data for a while The kit doesn't respond to user interaction with the ON/OFF button The LED is fixed and does not react to anything ... Pressing the reset button will not delete any configuration, it will simply restart your device. The light will go off and on and the device will start again with a white LED. This button is also to be used when reflashing the firmware, by double clicking it. Have a look at the guide here . You can also perform a reboot by disconnecting the battery and the USB cable so that the kit is restarted. In this way we will not lose any data or configuration. However, if we are in SD card mode , the kit won't know what time it is and we will need to give to him. For doing so: Press the ON/OFF button once. The LED should be breathing RED. Connect to the network SmartCitizen[...] and set it up again to log in SD card mode . The network won't show up \u00b6 Before configuring the Kit, if the SmartCitizen[...] network doesn't show up, make sure the LED is red. If not, press the button until the LED turns red. Factory reset your kit \u00b6 You can fully reset the Kit to the default settings so you can register again your device. Press the main button for 15 seconds . After 5 seconds the light will go off and will go on again after 15 seconds. Then you can release the button and your device will be fully resetted as a brand new Kit. The LED does not turn on and the kit does not work \u00b6 First of all, push the kit button. Maybe it's simply off. If this does not work, most likely the kit has been left without battery. You will have to charge it using the USB charger. Any other mobile charger will also work. We will know that it is charging when the LED emits orange pulses and once the battery is charged it will emit green . If the kit does not respond at all, it is probably worth trying with another USB cable, in case there is some problem there. If not, drop us an email or post on the forum The kit does not store the data on the SD card \u00b6 Some SD cards may have problems over time. We can try formatting it, but in case it does not work any micro SD card we buy at any mobile or computer store it will work. The size is not important and any micro SD or micro SDHC 512MB card up to 32GB will work. The kit does not boot with the PMS Sensor \u00b6 Make sure that you power the Smart Citizen Kit with a good enough USB cable and with an adaptor that can provide at least 1A. We have found some issues when powering the sensor with a thin cable, or from a weak power source, like a screen. Known (fixed) issues \u00b6 In this section, we will detail some problems you might have found in the early firmware versions of SCK 2.1. Light sensor reads 0 and temperature/humidity sensor does not work \u00b6 The issue is caused due to a firmware bug (light) and a problem with some SHT31 sensors (also fixed by firmware).

This is probably our best first try once the kit has any problem. You can see it here: Some issues this might help solving: The kit hasn't been posting data for a while The kit doesn't respond to user interaction with the ON/OFF button The LED is fixed and does not react to anything ... Pressing the reset button will not delete any configuration, it will simply restart your device. The light will go off and on and the device will start again with a white LED. This button is also to be used when reflashing the firmware, by double clicking it. Have a look at the guide here . You can also perform a reboot by disconnecting the battery and the USB cable so that the kit is restarted. In this way we will not lose any data or configuration. However, if we are in SD card mode , the kit won't know what time it is and we will need to give to him. For doing so: Press the ON/OFF button once. The LED should be breathing RED.

The sensor is designed for both indoors and outdoors use. But if you\u2019re planning to use it outdoors, you will have to consider purchasing also a rainproof enclosure. Can I make my own rainproof enclosure? \u00b6 Of course! The manufacturing files for the 3D printed enclosure will be available to download in the Enclosures repository . Throughout the history of the Smart Citizen project, we\u2019ve seen many inventive solutions for placing the sensor outdoors. Can I charge the sensors with a solar panel? \u00b6 Sure! But note that the sensor requires a 5V solar panel to work properly. Keeping that in mind, you can buy one of the photovoltaic panels that we provide, or run your own tests. Can I add external sensors to the system? \u00b6 Yes. The sensor has an independently configurable auxiliary bus at 3.3V with a SEEED Grove connector. The Bus has native support for I2C, but it can also be setup on firmware as a GPIO or UART. It can supply power up to 750mA, and it can be enabled or disabled by software. What happens if there is a loss of network connectivity? \u00b6 If the sensor is working in network mode and at any time the network is not available, it will store the data on its internal memory and publish all the collected data as soon as the network is available again. Which external sensors can be added? \u00b6 For the moment, the list of supported sensors includes some Atlas Scientific probes, some Seeed Grove sensors, and the Chirp moisture sensor, but the options are almost endless. We will add tutorials to use the additional sensors listed above in our documentation.However, in the short term we will only offer support for them via our custom hardware development services. Will I be able to access the collected data? \u00b6 Of course! The data collected by your sensor is available for anyone on the Smart Citizen Platform , and you can download it at any time as a CSV file. Besides, you can also use the API to built custom applications to interact with your device. How does the kit record the data? \u00b6 The sensor can work in network and SD card modes. In network mode, the sensor publish data to the SC platform over Wi-Fi every minute. In SD card mode, all the collected data is stored locally in CSV format, and it can be later uploaded manually to the platform using the \u201cManual Data Upload\u201d option. What networks does it support? \u00b6 The SCK supports Wi-Fi WEP, WPA/WPA2 and open networks that are common networks in domestic environments and small businesses. However, like many other embedded devices such as Apple TV\u00ae or Chromecast\u00ae, it does not support networks with captive portals such as those found in Airports and Hotels. Currently, it also does not WPA/WPA2 Enterprise networks such as EDUROAM. However, they will be supported in the future after a firmware updated. I have a firewall. What do I need to know? \u00b6 Here are the ports and protocols used by the Kit to communicate with the platform: Service Function Protocol Port Address MQTT Send Data TCP 80/443 mqtt.smartcitizen.me NTP Sync Time UDP 80 ntp.smartcitizen.me Notice we use custom ports already to avoid some firewall restrictions Is there a mobile phone app that lets me view the data? \u00b6 Currently there is an android app available, but we are working to make the website fully mobile device friendly, so that no mobile phone app is required. We would rather focus the time of our small team on the kits themselves instead of maintaining apps. So our final aim is to be app free, but fully mobile friendly. How accurate are the measurements? \u00b6 Weather, noise, light and PM sensor measurements have been calibrated and validated against reference sensors through both in-house and external validations and they provide accurate data. Chemical gas sensors are to be considered qualitatively rather than quantitatively while calibration algorithms are developed for data accuracy improvement. Are there any notable case studies using similar sensors? \u00b6 Yes! A particularly interesting case study is the Making Sense project at Plac\u0327a del Sol in Barcelona, where a group of 15 technology enthusiasts and environmentalists joined a community of neighbours from a middle-class district that has been suffering from noise issues due to the nightlife in the square. You can find more information about this case study at: www.making-sense.eu What happens if I want to move the device or give it to someone else? \u00b6 Just by pressing the button you can fully reset your sensor and configure it again using your account or a new one. All your previous data will remain available on the platform as it was before the reset. What about using other wireless technologies? \u00b6 We are working closely with Barcelona\u2019s The Things Network community to develop a TTN enabled sensor. A LoRA prototype has been tested, but we don\u2019t have dates for the final version yet. BLE, Zigbee, or others are not currently supported, and except for G5, we are not planning to implement them unless there is a custom hardware integration demand. Can I remove my data from the platform? \u00b6 Of course. You are the owner of the data that you collect, and you can download and/or delete all your sensor data at any time. How can I retrieve the MAC address from my device? \u00b6 You can retrieve the MAC address with two methods: either you can use your phone (see below), or follow this guide if you want to try out the console interface in the kit. Using your phone Set the SCK in setup mode (press the button once, the LED should turn red). With your phone, join the Wi-Fi network created by your Kit; it should be SmartCitizen[\u2026]. Once you are on your Kit configuration page, go to the Info section. You will see a page with all the information about your Kit. Your MAC address is listed as seen below: What batteries are shipped with the kits? \u00b6 The default SCK 2.1 Kits come with a 2000mAh LiPo battery model PL804050 (see datasheet and material safety data sheets ). For custom projects we also offer a bigger 6000mAh LiPo battery model DTP605068 (see datasheet and material safety data sheets ). We are working on a new dynamic battery calculator. Currently, you can find some approximate data here for the SCK 2.1. Are the electronics waterproof? \u00b6 No. They cannot be exposed to water, high humidity, corrosive environments, or moisture. Always use an enclosure when exposed outdoors. Highly humid environments can provoke corrosion in the sensors (symptom of this is blue powder near the sensors in the urban board). To help protect them, we recommend using transparent nail polish in these areas. Do not obscure the areas in red : If you are using any enclosure from the repository , we also recommend using a filtration foam (PPI-20/10) like this one .

For example the setup shown above is designed for soil measurements and includes Atlas Scientific temperature, conductivity and PH probes. It also consists of a Chirp Moisture Sensor as described in the above section . As an additional example the setup in the figure below is designed for water monitoring on aquaponics systems and includes Atlas Scientific probes for PH, conductivity and dissolved oxygen.

For this, we recommend a larger solar panel with a lead-acid battery instead as back-up. Image credit: Voltaic System We use an MPTT Sunflower Solar power manager 5V from DF Robot for managing the solar input with an additional 2Ah battery. It is fitted inside the enclosure with a small laser cut (or 3D printed if not available) flange. This is the BOM for this option.

This module is powered by an ARM M0+ 32-bits 48Mhz SAMD21 running the Smart Citizen Firmware , combining the low power consumption of the ARM M0 family with the power of a 32-bits processor with 32KB of RAM and 256KB of FLASH memory. This solution offers enough program storage and memory space to support multiple auxiliary sensors. This chip is used by the Arduino Zero and MKR boards, therefore benefiting from the open community built around these boards in particular and the Arduino project in general. Check the source code The data board also includes a Wi-Fi module, a micro SD card slot, an internal Flash and a battery management solution. In addition, it includes 4MB of extra Flash Memory for offline data storage, in case of network brownouts. The Wi-Fi Module is the well-known Espressif ESP8266 IEEE 802.11 b/g/n Wi-Fi with 4MB Internal Flash for web content storage: The Data Board connects to the sensor board providing power, analog and digital communications (12 bits ADC, GPIO, I2C, I2S, VCC). The data board also includes a Seeed Studio standard Grove connector where off-the-shelf modules from the same manufacturer can be connected. The connector supports an independent I2C bus by default, but by software it can be configured to support other uses (GPIO, I2C and UART). It can supply power up to 750mA, and it can be enabled or disabled by software to save power. The board includes a power unit, with a battery management system, capable of handling a variety of Lithium polymer cells. The batteries are connected to a standard JST-2 pin battery connector. The Smart Citizen Kit by default uses a 2000mAh battery, but larger capacities can be used. Under normal conditions, and depending on the sensors enabled, a 2000mAh battery can last between 24 hours (with all sensors enabled, and a 1-minute recording frequency) to more than a week. The board also features a sleep mode , through which drastically lower average consumption are achieved. The controller allows the batteries to be easily charged using the boards micro USB connector using any standard USB power adapter like the ones used on Smartphones. On remote areas, it can also be powered using a selection of PV Panels like Voltaics Systems 6W panel. Firmware \u00b6 The Smart Citizen Kit firmware is comprised of two parts: 1) the primary processing tasks are done by the SAMD21 microcontroller firmware; 2) the tasks related to network communication are run through the ESP8266. The SAMD21 is built on top of the Arduino Zero with a custom variant for the Data Board main MCU. The ESP8266 is also built using the Arduino ESP Core. Both firmwares are built and managed with Platform IO, an open-source IDE for embedded development. Platform IO features built-in dependency management and allows you to compile and upload both processors with a single command. Using the SWD ARM connector you can change the MCU bootloader and debug the firmware using Open Source tools. Info Learn more about the software running inside the Data Board on the Firmware section . Software guides Check the firmware guides and learn how to update and even modify the software: Edit the Firmware Update the Firmware Debug the Firmware (advanced) Buses \u00b6 Sensor Boards connector \u00b6 The Kit features a modular architecture where sensors can be updated independently by replacing any individual Sensor Board. The Sensor Boards features GPIO, ADC, I2C, UART and I2S connections at 3.3V. Currently, we only offer the Urban Sensor Board, but more boards are on the way, and you can even design and build a custom one.

The Bus has native support for I2C, but it can also be setup on firmware as a GPIO or UART port. It can supply power up to 750mA, and it can be enabled or disabled by software. Example of devices connected via the AUX connector. Power management \u00b6 The Smart Smart Citizen Kit gives us the possibility of running directly from a USB power source with or without lithium battery, using the BQ24259 USB Charger . The charger manages external power regulation, battery fast charging (up to 2Ah) and USB OTG that allow us powering other devices from the SCK (currently not implemented). Normaly the SCK uses a 2000 mAh Lithium polymer battery but it is possible to take advantage of larger batteries. The charging current is regulated with a manual imposed limit that can be configured, and also auto adjusts to the connected USB charger capacity. It is also possible to use solar panel (5v) to charge the SCK. The power consumption of the kit depends on which sensors are enabled and how often they are read/published. Between readings the kit goes to sleep mode turning off almost all the subsystems and reducing the power consumption. In previous versions of the kit (V2.0 and before), the most power-hungry sensors were the SGX MICS gas sensors (NO 2 and CO) which need an always-on heater with a permanent consumption of around 50 mAh (35 hours per charge). In V2.0 and V2.1, the PM sensor needs a fan with a consumption of 35 mAh (50 hours per charge). To improve the power consumption, the PM Sensor works on one-shot mode which turns the sensor off for \u00beths of the time, and only taking a reading after the sensor has stabilised. The kit normal operation cycle on battery is: read sensors, post, and then go to sleep. Until the battery charge is below 3%. When that threshold is passed it will enter an emergency sleep mode and interrupt all the normal functions until the charge goes over 5%. Power consumption \u00b6 The base power consumption of the device is 16mA (no sensors or wifi connection). While posting data online, the consumption can go up to 75mA accounting for the ESP8266, with an additional 90mA if all the sensors are to be working at the same time (Urban Sensor Board + PM sensor).

The Urban Sensor Board has undergone several modifications throughout its development, and its current version is V2.1 : An iteration with a different set of sensors was developed as part of the iScape Project and is shown in the image below: Check the source code A major effort has been carried out on this design to improve the accuracy of the data provided. The sensors on the board include: Air Temperature, Relative Humidity, Noise Levels and Spectrum, Ambient Light and Barometric Pressure. The board also features a section especially focused on Air Quality including a Particle Matter Sensor, and, in version V2.1, an eCO2 and TVOC sensor. Previously, in version V2.0, a Carbon Monoxide and a Nitrogen Dioxide sensors was included, but due to the high power consumption and the need of important calibration efforts, these were removed. The sensor density of the board design offers more than ten different environmental metrics at a very low cost and differentiates the design from other existing solutions.

SETUP YOUR SMART Smart Citizen Kit In order to have your kit connected to the Smart Citizen platform, we need a few step involving the connexion of your kit to your computer. This tool will help you register your kit to the platform, setup your kit's Wi-Fi settings and update its firmware. Currently we support Google Chrome in Win, Mac and Linux. If you are on Windows check first How to install the drivers on Windows? section for more information. Click on the ADD TO CHROME button and wait for the extension to install. Finally its time to unpack your SCK. Connect the micro USB cable to your SCK and your computer and turn on the SCK switch on the upper left corner. On the dropdown menu you should select the port your SCK is connected. On Mac and Linux the port will be named Smartcitizen or something like /dev/ttyACM0. On Windows this is likely to be COM3 or higher (COM1 and COM2 are usually reserved for hardware serial ports). To find out, you can disconnect your SCK and check the dropdown; the entry that disappears should be the SCK board. Reconnect the board and select that serial port. If you have any issue check your kit is properly connected, switched ON and you do not have the Arduino IDE or other software that uses the serial port open. We recommend you to switch your kit OFF and ON in order to reset the kit before you start. Now just click Start process in order to start configuring your kit. The configurator will try to determine your hardware and firmware version, if your firmware version is below 0.9.3 you need to update the firmware in order to continue with the process. If the configurator can't communicate with your board it will report an Unrecognized board , we recommend you to try a couple of times, disconnecting your kit, reloading the page and connecting it again to make sure that this is not just a serial port communication problem. If the configurator still can't communicate with your kit it may be a firmware/hardware problem. You may try to install the firmware and see if this solves the problem. If you can't upload the firmware please refer to the Firmware update problem section or try doing a Manual set up. After firmware is installed/updated we can continue with Wi-Fi settings. You can add up to 5 different Wi-Fi credentials in your kit.

Take care your SCK can be registered once at a time, in case you registered before check How to unlink your SCK? or contact support@smartcitizen.me . Please, if your kit is not publishing properly contact support@smartcitizen.me or ask for help in the forum . Manual set up: The Serial Way \u00b6 In this tutorial aimed to advanced users you will configure your SCK using serial communication. By using serial communication, you will register your Wi-Fi settings into the SCK and save the SCK\u2019s MAC address in our server. The SCK, like most Arduino chips, has the ability to communicate through serial protocol (when plugged with a proper USB cable). The SCK uses the WiFly module to communicate with your Wi-Fi router. Anyway, through serial communication you will be able to send the commands directly with this module to set your Wi-Fi settings and extract the MAC address used by our server to verify your identity. Note that this tutorial works for both SCK v1.0 (from the Goteo crowdfunding campaign) and SCK v1.1 (from the KickStarter crowdfunding campaign), independently of the firmware version used. Configuring the Wi-Fi settings \u00b6 Open Arduino IDE. Connect your SCK via USB. From the Tools > Board menu, choose the right USB port (generally the last one). From the Tools > Serial port menu, select the right board. This is Leonardo for SCK v1.0 (Goteo) or LilyPad Arduino USB for SCK v1.1 (Kickstarter). Open the serial monitor window in the Arduino IDE (button at the top-right of the main window). Set the options to \"115200 baud\" and \u201cNo line return\u201d (drop-down menu at the bottom-right of the monitor window). Wake up the module and activate the Wi-Fi command mode by typing in the serial monitor: $$$ Change to \u201cCarriage return\u201d option (drop-down menu at the bottom-right of the monitor window) Add a new SSID to memory by typing: set wlan ssid XXX Note: You have to replace XXX with your ssid name, filling any space with the dollar ($) character. Due to hardware limitations it can't be longer than 32 characters. Add a new phrase to memory (optional, password for WPA1 & WPA2): set wlan phrase XXX Note: You have to replace XXX with your phrase, filling any space with the dollar ($) character. Add a new key to memory (optional, password for WEP & WEP64): set wlan key XXX Add an authentication method into memory (replace XXX by \u201c0\u201d for Open, \u201c1\u201d for WEP, \u201c2\u201d for WPA1, \u201c4\u201d for WPA2, \u201c8\u201d for WEP64): set wlan auth XXX Add an antenna type into memory (replace XXX by \u201c0\u201d to use the internal antenna or \u201c1\u201d if you use an external antenna): set wlan ext_antenna XXX Get the MAC address of the kit by typing: get mac Copy/Save the answer for further use. Exit and go back to the normal operational mode by typing: exit Registering the kit in the platform \u00b6 After you've uploaded your settings, don't forget to register your kit in our database by saving it's mac address. To find the mac address, you can use the serial command \"get mac\". Or have a look at the wifi module on the board and read the serial number under the bar code (something like \"131G0006662116E4\" on kit v1.0 or \"0006662116E4\" on kit v.1.1). The mac address is the last 12 digit of this serial, separated by a colon every two number. From a number like 0006662116E4 you would write 00:06:66:21:16:E4 . In both cases, you have to fill the mac address input field in the configuration page of your kit and press the save button. You are now done with the manual configuration of your SCK. Wait for a few minutes to see your data coming on the server and being displayed on the web page. You can also check that everything is ok by looking at the Arduino serial monitor. Debug messages coming from your SCK should look like this: If you want to explore further options with the WiFly module check The SCK Command Line section. If you encounter any issue, please share your problem on the forum Manual set up: The Compilation Way \u00b6 This tutorial is aimed to advanced users, we will guide you through the process of setting up your kit by editing directly the source code. As the code is Open Source, one way of setting the Wi-Fi of your SCK is to download the latest firmware, edit some lines of code, recompile it and upload it to the kit. One advantage of this method is that it gives you the opportunity to register multiple Wi-Fi networks at the same time and make the persistent. The Wi-fi networks that you register directly in the source code are called hardcoded and the only way to remove them is with the same process of compiling and uploading the firmware again. This is useful if your SCK is traveling from one location to another where the Wi-Fi credentials are known. The downside of this method is that you can not extract the MAC address of your kit, if you don't know it yet you will have to use the method described in The Serial Way or via the configurator in the setup page of your kit. Getting the Firmware \u00b6 You can download the latest firmware on our Github: https://github.com/fablabbcn/Smart-Citizen-Kit/releases As you may know, the hardware and software are based on the Arduino project. We will use the Arduino IDE to edit the firmware and upload it to the kit. This tutorial have been tested with Arduino 1.6.8, please download and install the Arduino IDE . Once installed open the file Smart-Citizen-Kit/sck_beta_v0_9_0/sck_beta_v0_9.ino Editing the code \u00b6 If you want to set the network configuration manually, you should go to the Constants.h tab and modify the lines you see below: #define networks 0 #if (networks > 0) static char* mySSID[networks] = { \"SSID1\" , \"SSID2\" }; static char* myPassword[networks] = { \"PASS1\" , \"PASS2\" }; static char* wifiEncript[networks] = { WPA2 , WPA2 }; static char* antennaExt[networks] = { INT_ANT , INT_ANT }; #endif The easiest way would be to write \"#define networks X\" (where X is the number of WI-FI networks you are going to use) and fill the options for your network: Add the name of your network in SSIDX and the corresponding password in PASSX . Due to hardware limitations neither the password or the ssid can't be longer tham 32 characters. On wifiEncript you could also choose the encryption mode that fits with your network's configuration ( OPEN , WEP , WPA1 , WPA2 , WEP64 ). On antennaExt you can choose the type of antenna you are using ( INT_ANT for internal antenna (default) or EXT_ANT for external antenna). If you register only one wifi credential, you should obtain something like this: #define networks 1 #if (networks > 0) char* mySSID[networks] = { \"MyWifiSSID\" }; char* myPassword[networks] = { \"MyPassword\" }; char* wifiEncript[networks] = { WPA2 }; char* antennaExt[networks] = { INT_ANT }; #endif Note that if you configure more than one Wi-fi network you have to separate the variables with a comma, for example: char* mySSID[networks] = { \"MyFirstSSID\", \"MySecondSSID\" }; Uploading the code \u00b6 On the Arduino IDE Tools menu you should select the right Board in the Boards menu: For SmartSmart Citizen Kit version 1.0 select Arduino Leonardo (ATmega 32U4 at 16Mhz) For SmartSmart Citizen Kit version 1.1 select Arduino LilyPad USB (ATmega 32U4 at 8Mhz) The Arduino IDE should automatically select the right USB port but you can check it in the Tools >> Port menu. Now you just need to click the Upload button and Arduino will do the rest for you! In case you have any issue please check the Arduino Troubleshooting guide. Registering the kit in the platform \u00b6 After you\u2019ve uploaded your settings, don\u2019t forget to register your kit in our database by saving it\u2019s mac address. To find the mac address, you can use the serial command \u201cget mac\u201d by following the section The Serial Way . Or have a look at the wifi module on the board and read the serial number under the bar code (something like \u201c131G0006662116E4\u201d on kit v1.0 or \u201c0006662116E4\u201d on kit v.1.1). The mac address is the last 12 digit of this serial, separated by a colon every two number. From a number like 0006662116E4 you would write 00:06:66:21:16:E4 . In both cases, you have to fill the mac address input field in the configuration page of your kit and press the save button. You are now done with the manual configuration of your SCK. Wait for a few minutes to see your data coming on the server and being displayed on the web page. You can also check that everything is ok by looking the output of your kit via the Arduino serial monitor. If you encounter any issue, please share your problem on the forum Attaching the solar panel \u00b6 The solar panel should fulfill the specification of a voltage bigger than 8v and less than 15v, 12v is the recommended voltage, and a minimum of 500mA. In order to attach the solar panel you have to solder the cables of the solar panel to the pads marked in the next image for version 1.0 of the SCK. For version 1.1 you have to connect the cables to the connector marked in the next image. In both versions, yo have to attach the plus of solar panel to the plus pad of the SCK, and the minus of the solar panel to the minus pad of the SCK.","title":"Main"},{"location":"Components/legacy/#getting-started","text":"","title":"Getting Started"},{"location":"Components/legacy/#installing-a-smart-smart-citizen-kit-10-11","text":"Welcome aboard!

The Wi-fi networks that you register directly in the source code are called hardcoded and the only way to remove them is with the same process of compiling and uploading the firmware again. This is useful if your SCK is traveling from one location to another where the Wi-Fi credentials are known. The downside of this method is that you can not extract the MAC address of your kit, if you don't know it yet you will have to use the method described in The Serial Way or via the configurator in the setup page of your kit.","title":"Manual set up: The Compilation Way"},{"location":"Components/legacy/#getting-the-firmware","text":"You can download the latest firmware on our Github: https://github.com/fablabbcn/Smart-Citizen-Kit/releases As you may know, the hardware and software are based on the Arduino project.

How to install the drivers on Windows? \u00b6 In Windows you will need to install the Arduino Drivers if you haven't done it before. Windows 8, 7, Vista, and XP \u00b6 Go to the Arduino download page and download the latest version of the Arduino software for Windows. When the download is finished, un-zip it and open up the Arduino folder to confirm that yes, there are indeed some files and sub-folders inside. The file structure is important so don\u2019t be moving any files around unless you really know what you\u2019re doing. Power up your Smart Smart Citizen Kit by connecting it to your computer with a USB cable. You should see the green LED near the on/off switch light up. If you\u2019re running Windows 8, you\u2019ll need to disable driver signing, so go see the Windows 8 section. If you\u2019re running Windows 7, Vista, or XP, you\u2019ll need to install some drivers, so head to the Windows 7, Vista, and XP section down below. Windows 8 \u00b6 Windows 8 comes with a nice little security \u2018feature\u2019 that \u2018protects\u2019 you from unsigned driver installation. The Smart Smart Citizen Kit driver is not signed so you\u2019ll have to tell Windows to disable driver signing. This issue has been addressed in newer releases of the Arduino IDE, but if you run into issues, you can try this fix first. For a nice, step-by-step tutorial with pictures click here , otherwise the steps are outlined below. To temporarily disable driver signing: From the Metro Start Screen, open Settings (move your mouse to the bottom-right-corner of the screen and wait for the pop-out bar to appear, then click the Gear icon) Click \u2018More PC Settings\u2019 Click \u2018General\u2019 Scroll down, and click \u2018Restart now\u2019 under \u2018Advanced startup\u2019. Wait a bit. Click \u2018Troubleshoot\u2019. Click \u2018Advanced Options\u2019 Click \u2018Windows Startup Settings\u2019 Click Restart. When your computer restarts, select \u2018Disable driver signature enforcement\u2018 from the list. To permanently disable driver signing (recommended, but has some minor security implications): Go to the metro start screen Type in \u201ccmd\u201d Right click \u201cCommand Prompt\u201d and select \u201cRun as Administrator\u201d from the buttons on the bottom of your screen Type/paste in the following commands: bcdedit -set loadoptions DISABLE_INTEGRITY_CHECKS bcdedit -set TESTSIGNING ON Reboot! Windows 7, Vista, and XP \u00b6 Installing the Drivers for the Arduino Uno (from Arduino.cc) Plug in your board and wait for Windows to begin it\u2019s driver installation process After a few moments, the process will fail, despite its best efforts Click on the Start Menu, and open up the Control Panel While in the Control Panel, navigate to System and Security. Next, click on System Once the System window is up, open the Device Manager Look under Ports (COM & LPT). You should see an open port named \u201cArduino UNO (COMxx)\u201d. If there is no COM & LPT section, look under \u2018Other Devices\u2019 for \u2018Unknown Device\u2019 Right click on the \u201cArduino UNO (COMxx)\u201d or \u201cUnknown Device\u201d port and choose the \u201cUpdate Driver Software\u201d option Next, choose the \u201cBrowse my computer for Driver software\u201d option Finally, navigate to and select the Uno\u2019s driver file, named \u201cArduinoUNO.inf\u201d, located in the \u201cDrivers\u201d folder of the Arduino Software download (not the \u201cFTDI USB Drivers\u201d sub-directory). If you cannot see the .inf file, it is probably just hidden. You can select the \u2018drivers\u2019 folder with the \u2018search sub-folders\u2019 option selected instead. Windows will finish up the driver installation from there This documentation is proudly based on Sparkfun Arduino on Windows tutorial - CC BY-NC-SA 3.0. Which LiPo batteries to use? \u00b6 The battery that we are providing is 3.7v and 2000mAh Which solar panels to use? \u00b6 The solar panel it should fulfill the specification of a voltage bigger than 8v and less than 15v, 12v is the recommended voltage, and a minimum of 500mA. How I can extend the Wi-Fi range? \u00b6 Is your SCK quite far away from Wi-Fi access point? You can use an external antenna with your SCK. The Wi-Fi modules has a U.FL antenna connector. We recommend you to use a U.FL to RP-SMA adaptor in order to use standard Wi-Fi antennas . You then will need to enable the External Antenna on the Wi-Fi setup process by selecting External Antenna . What is the spec (battery type) for the button-cell for the RTC? \u00b6 The RTC battery is a CR1220 Why is 50dB the microphone lowest value? \u00b6 Because the actual sensor is limited by the curve bounding from 50dB to 103dB Browsers compatibility \u00b6 The SmartCitizen platform is built using the latest Web technologies (such as HTML5, SVG and CSS3). These languages serve as a foundation for today\u2019s websites and web applications. To enjoy Smart Citizen, we recommend you to use: Google Chrome 25+ Firefox Mozilla 20+ For the kit setup process only Google Chrome is supported. What are the LEDs for, and what does the LED blinking mean? \u00b6 There are 5 LEDs, they are all on the base half of the SCK. They can be understood in three groups: LED2 and LED1 - These are the two yellow (or orange) LEDs in the lower center-left of the board. You will only see these lit when your USB cable is connected to the SCK and you are configuring or otherwise interacting with the SCK. LED2 is the \"RX USB\" and will be lit when the SCK is receiving information via the USB connection. LED1 is the \"TX USB\" and will be lit when the SCK is sending information via the USB connection. LED4 and LED3 - These are the two blue LEDs in the lower center of the board. You will see these blink often. LED3 is the \"WiFi Association\" and LED4 is the \"WiFi Connection.\" The blue LEDs will blink each time the SCK posts new data wirelessly. This is normal behavior and is expected, but it only happens in bursts (then there will be no blue LED lit for about 30-40 seconds). If your blue LEDs are blinking back and forth non-stop, this means your SCK has lost its WiFi connection. Check to make sure your router is still on, and that you're still in range of it. LED5 - This is the green LED in the upper left corner. It will be lit when the SCK is turned on and has power.","title":"FAQ"},{"location":"Components/legacy/Faq/#faq","text":"","title":"FAQ"},{"location":"Components/legacy/Faq/#how-do-i-register-again-my-sck","text":"It is really important to understand a SCK can be just registered one time to one device in the platform.

Industrial (RN-131G) and commercial (RN-131C) grade temperature options WIFLY module - RN-131 datasheet BATTERY POWERING \u00b6 For powering the SCK, in both versions, we are using a 3.7v 2000 mAh li-on battery. SCK version 1.0 uses two different voltages, 3.3V and 5V to power the IC\u2019s. To get 5V from 3.3v we are using a step-up based on NCP1400, thus having a stable voltage at 5v and 100mA. On the other hand, to regulate the voltage and to obtain 3.3v, the SCK uses the IC MAX604. NCP1400 datasheet MAX604 datasheet In 1.1 version, to make things simpler, the voltage of entire SCK was unified to 3.3V. The responsible to regulate the voltage from 3.7v to 3.3v is the MCP1725 IC. MCP1725 datasheet BATTERY CHARGING \u00b6 For charging the battery there are two ways, USB or solar panel. To carry out the charging we are using MCP73831 IC. For charging the battery in 1.0 version the solar panel have to be 12v and 500mA. In 1.1 version, the solar panel can be more versatile in terms of amperage. MCP73831 datasheet SOLAR PANEL CHARGING \u00b6 Depending on the sunlight conditions the solar panel produces up to 12v, we have to reduce the voltage to 5v to feed up the Vin of the MCP73831 charger IC. To carry out this task we are using the LM2674 IC, a very efficient IC, with a rate of 91% of performance. LM2674 datasheet RTC (REAL TIME CLOCK) \u00b6 The SCK has a real time clock for keeping track of time when the kit is offline. For this task we chose the DS1307 IC for the 1.0 version and the DS1339Y-3+ IC for the 1.1 version. Different IC due to the different voltages, 5V for the 1.0 version and 3.3V for the 1.1 version. DS1307 datasheet DS1339Y-3+ datasheet SD CARD READER \u00b6 The SD card is used to store the data captured by the sensors when the kit is offline. When the kit gets connected, the data will be reeded from the SD card and uploaded to the platform. To hold the SD card we are using the DM3CS holder. The SD card is powered at 3.3V and communicates with the CPU through SPI protocol. DM3CS datasheet EEPROM MEMORY \u00b6 For the users that don\u2019t have a SD card we\u2019ve added an EEPROM memory to store the data when the SCK is offline. We chose the 24LC256 IC that can store 32kBytes, it communicates with the CPU through I2C protocol. 24LC256 datasheet MAIN BOARD BASIC SENSORS \u00b6 The main board has some basic sensors: Measurement of the battery level Measurement of the solar panel level Measurement of the wireless networks detected SENSOR BOARD \u00b6 The sensor board contains the necessary sensors for measuring all the other parameters. This means NO2 and CO gases, sunlight, noise pollution, temperature, humidity. Also, the sensor board has an I2C bus, this allows to expand the SCK to other kind of sensors. NO2 AND CO SENSORS \u00b6 To measure these two gases we chose e2v sensors. In particular, metal oxide sensors MICS5525 and MICS2710, for version 1.0. And MICS4514, for version 1.1, that contains both sensors in one. Metal oxide sensors are based on oxide semiconductors. Their electrical conductivity is modulated due to the reaction between the semiconductor and the gases in the atmosphere. MICS5525 datasheet MICS2710 datasheet MICS4514 datasheet LIGHT SENSOR \u00b6 The light sensor is a basic element to know the light pollution. In version 1.0, was used a LDR (light-dependent resistor) whose voltage varies depending on the light conditions. For version 1.1, was used a photodiode BH1730FVC. This sensor contains an I2C bus that gives us directly the amount of lux of ambient and infrared light. BH1730FVC datasheet NOISE SENSOR \u00b6 The noise sensor is based on an electret microphone. For the version 1.0 WM-61A was used as the microphone, the captured audio signal is passed through an operational amplifier configured as band pass filter. For the version 1.1 POM-3044P-R was used. WM-61A datasheet POM-3044P-R datasheet TEMPERATURE AND HUMIDITY SENSOR \u00b6 To measure temperature and humidity a module that integrates both sensors was used. For version 1.0 the RHT22 was used, it has one wire digital interface. For version 1.1 the SHT21 was used, it has I2C protocol and faster response between measures than the RHT22. RHT22 datasheet SHT21 datasheet 3 AXIS ACCELEROMETER \u00b6 In version 1.0 we detected that some measures vary depending on the orientation of the SCK. That's why in version 1.1 we added the ADXL345 accelerometer to detect the position and to compensate the measures depending on the orientation of the SCK. This accelerometer communicates via I2C protocol with the kit. ADXL345 datasheet I2C EXPANSION BUS \u00b6 Due to the ease of the I2C protocol.

This sensor was introduced in the SCK2.1, in replacement of the SGX MICS4514 from previous designs. As mentioned in other parts of the documentation, this decission was mainly due to the lower power consumption of the CCS811 and the easy implementation of reading processing provided by the manufacturer. Does it measure CO2? No. Despite the name, the sensor does not measure CO2. See below for a detailed description of the sensor measurements. Measurements \u00b6 eCO2 and eTVOC are two related measurements. The first stands for equivalent CO2 , and it's an indication of the concentration of CO2 that would cause the same level of radiative forcing as a given type and concentration of greenhouse gas. The eCO2 measurement is therefore a derived measurement from the reactions all these substances in the air with the metal oxide substrate in the sensor. eCO2 bottomline starts at 400ppm (current background CO2, sadly) and can reach several thousands. On the other hand, eTVOC stands for equivalent total volatile organic compounds and is a measurement of the total amount of any emitted gases coming from toxins and chemicals. They come from a wide range of everyday items including paints and varnishes, wax and cosmetics, cleaning and hobby products, and even cooking. When you have an enclosed space like a home or office, these emitted gases accumulate and pollute our fresh air. Global Warming Potential \u00b6 To understand the eCO2 readings , we need to know what is the Global Warming Potential ( GWP for short). GWP is an estimate of how much a given greenhouse gas contributes to Earth\u2019s radiative forcing. We know that CO2 is one of the major contributors to global warming, but there are others (and that are much worse). For example: CO2 has a value of 1 GWP, whereas methane has a GWP of 72 over 20 years, but a lower GWP of 25 over 100 years. This is because it is very potent in the short-term but then breaks down to CO2 and water in the atmosphere, meaning that the longer the period you consider it over, the more similar its effect is to that of CO2 alone. This means that 1ppm of CH4 is much more worrying for the global warming of the planet than 1ppm CO2 in the short term, because it can produce a higher increment of the atmosphere temperature. All this is at the same time interesting and worrying, because many products used for painting, solvents, varnish, refrigeration, and more contain pollutants with high GWP. A very interesting article can be found here . Working principle \u00b6 As any metal oxide sensor, the CCS811 measures the resistance of a sensitive layer, exposed to ambient air. This layer is heated up with a heater element (a resistance) up to several hundred \u00baC, and some oxidation reactions take place on it. The characteristics of the sensitive element vary from sensor to sensor, and with time, depending as well on the exposure to different chemical components and ambient conditions. For this reason an individual sensor charactersition is very tricky , and relative measurements are used, using an internal processing that monitors the baseline resistance of the sensor (i.e., the resistance of the sensitive layer when exposed to clean air). The sensor generally targets pollutants that can get oxidised in the sensor substrate. This oxidation process modifies the resistance of the sensor, and the more oxidation reactions we have the lower the resistance is. The concept of baseline resistance in this sense can be confusing, but basically can be explained as: the higher resistance, the cleaner the environment. Temperature and humidity are used internally to compensate the readings, as the sensor compares it\u2019s actual resistance with the clean air one (baseline), and inputs the ambient conditions in the correction. Sensor considerations \u00b6 Like any sensor, the CCS811 has some limitations. As mentioned above, the sensitive layer will decrease it's resistance when in presence of VOCs , but other pollutants can have the opposite effect on it. For instance, Ozone (O3) will increase the sensor's resistance, and it could be seen as clean air by the sensor. This could explain why in some outdoor environments (generally with traffic and high levels of sun radiation), the sensor can present an unstable behaviour. Additionally, humidity is known to affect the sensor resistance. The internal humidity correction can limit this effect up to a certain extent, but a perfect correction is not possible. We also recommend setting the sensor in a stable environment, in which temperature and relative humidity changes are not abrupt. When moving the sensor to another location, beware that any high resistance could be seen as the new baseline resistance , and this value might not apply to the previous environment, should you put the sensor back into it's original location. Resetting the baseline resistance The sensor keeps track of the baseline resistance even after a factory reset. Currently, there is no method to reset the baseline resistance in the firmware, but it will soonly be introduced. When changing locations, a baseline resistance reset should be performed. Finally, although the sensor is considered to be an indoor sensor, it can be placed outdoor , but keeping in mind, that the environment will be very different and that the sensor might behave in unexpected ways. Sources Have a read to the Datasheet or some other ANs here Early-Life (Burn-In) \u00b6 The CCS811 performance in terms of resistance levels and sensitivities will change during early life. The change in resistance is greatest over the first 48 hours of operation, although this process can last up to 5 days. CCS811 controls the burn-in period allowing eCO2 and eTVOC readings to be used from first power-on after 60 minutes of operation. Conditioning Period (Run-In) \u00b6 After early-life (Burn-In) the conditioning or run-in period is the time required to achieve good sensor stability before measuring VOCs after long idle period. The sensor will need to run for 20 minutes, before accurate readings are generated.","title":"eCO2/TVOC"},{"location":"Components/sensors/air/CCS811/#eco2-and-tvoc-sensor","text":"The AMS CCS811 is a Metal Oxide Sensor with I2C connectivity which is capable of measuring a volatile organic compounds (VOCs for short).

That is, they generate a current that is linearly proportional to the fractional volume of the toxic gas in the environment: Image Source: Alphasense Ltd. These electrochemical sensors are comprised of four electrodes: Working electrode Auxiliary electrode Counter electrode Reference electrode The working electrode is where the oxidation (CO, H2S, NO, SO2) or reduction (NO 2 , Cl2) of the toxic gas to be measured takes place. This electrode is exposed to the outside air and directly exposed to all gases in the air including the gas to be measured. This electrode may as well be poisoned if it is exposed to certain gases that either adsorb onto the catalyst (such as acetylene onto CO sensors), or react, creating by-products which inhibit the catalyst (NO 2 or aromatics onto H2S sensors). The auxiliary electrode is an electrode of the same characteristics to those of the working electrode, but it is buried inside an electrolite and, hence, it is not in contact with the target gas. Since it is isolated from external conditions that could affect the working electrode , it serves as a reference to the measurements provided by the latter. The counter electrode balances the reaction of the working electrode \u2013 if the working electrode oxidises the gas, then the counter electrode must reduce some other molecule to generate an equivalent current, in the opposite sense. For example, where carbon monoxide will be oxidised on the working electrode, oxygen will be reduced on the counter electrode. The reference electrode anchors the working electrode potential to ensure that it is always working in the right conditions. It is important that the reference electrode has a stable potential, keeping the working electrode at the right electrochemical potential to maintain a constant sensitivity, good linearity and minimum sensitivity to interfering gases. Therefore, while the sensor response is exposed to the target gas, it creates a current flowing from the working to the counter electrode or viceversa (depending on the oxidative or reductive nature of the target gas). This current has been found to be nicely responsive to target gas and therefore subject to characterisation and calibration. Reduction vs Oxidation Electrochemical Sensor \u00b6 As mentioned above, the counter electrode is meant to balance the reaction of the working electrode. This determines the current direction within the board: whether it goes from the working electrode to the counter electrode or viceversa. Oxidation sensors, such as CO, provoke a positive current out of the working electrode and the larger the amount of CO present, the larger (positive) is this current. Reduction sensors, such as NO 2 , provoke a negative current, i.e: going into the sensor and the larger the amount of NO 2 present, the larger (negative) is this current Usage and considerations \u00b6 Alphasense Ltd. provides the calibration data in laboratory conditions for each of the electrochemical cells used. This data can be used to calculate pollutant concentration and to correct for known effects by temperature deviations. More on this Alphasense Ltd. provides very useful application notes for the sensor usage. Pollutant calculation based on calibration data in laboratory conditions, can be insightful enough for certain applications, but it might not suffice for some conditions in which the sensors are exposed to other pollutants or in harsh environments. For this reason, two different approaches build on top of the laboratory calibration data: Usage of more advanced physical models as detailed in 1 Usage of site-specific calibration models with short-term deployments in co-location with reference measurement equipment and generalised calibration models derived from the junction of these 4 . Stabilisation \u00b6 The electrochemical sensors need stabilisation time under the testing conditions they will be at. It is important to set and power the sensors with sufficient time (1-2 days) on the test environment for them to adapt. The newer the sensor, the more stabilisation time it requires. For this deployment, you will be receiving brand new sensors. Humidity and temperature extremes will require of further sensor adaptation, in order to dry out or absorb the necessary humidity for their proper functioning. Danger Do not extract/attach the sensor capsule from the base board while powered, this could irreversibly damage the sensor. Open questions \u00b6 These methods, however, are still open to discussion and more research is necessary to address all use cases. For this reason, the use of these sensors in the Smart Citizen Station is tailored to each use and adapted to the calibration needs of the deployment. Characterisation techniques based on manufacturer data and physical models (i.e. classical linear regression using sensor sensitivity, span and zero) require a big development effort in order to characterise the sensor behaviour that, in the case of low-cost sensors, is affected by a wide variety of external factors such as temperature, humidity and pollutant cross-sensitivity, each of which imply a larger characterisation effort and that can\u2019t be fully represented in a controlled setting. On the other hand, statistical models are able to generate models that describe the sensor behaviour in a mathematical way, but they need to be properly adjusted with large amounts of test data, preferably in the actual deployment site. This approach can be applied per sensor, or to a batch of sensors, assuming that the inter-sensor variation is low or that they can be normalised. In the case of deploying the sensors in different locations, the conditions of these sites should be sufficiently similar to those when the model was generated, since many models won\u2019t be able to extrapolate well, or account for effects they have not seen (i.e. temperature gradients, specific pollutants, etc). How much is \u200bsufficiently similar\u200b, depends on the type of model and it is not easy to determine and, since this is not often assessed easily, researchers suggest ( 5 , 6 ) that a co-location prior to and post data acquisition with reference sensors should be carried out. In any case, the development of these models highly depends on the amount and quality of the data obtained from both: sensor data and reference data. In the case of reference data 6 have pointed out that reference stations can deviate up to 15% from the actual pollutant concentration, but this has not been taken into account in this study. Since co-location possibilities could be limited, two options are compared for the calibration of these sensors: a specific on-site calibration with sensor co-location, aiming to calibrate the sensors with the data from that period; and a general model approach, in which all the co-location tests from the different sensors deployed are input into a statistical model that aims to describe the global behaviour. Whether these methods are able to generalise or not, it's yet to be answered, and it's probably to be defined for each use case in particular.

For this reason, two different approaches build on top of the laboratory calibration data: Usage of more advanced physical models as detailed in 1 Usage of site-specific calibration models with short-term deployments in co-location with reference measurement equipment and generalised calibration models derived from the junction of these 4 .","title":"Usage and considerations"},{"location":"Components/sensors/air/Electrochemical%20Sensors/#stabilisation","text":"The electrochemical sensors need stabilisation time under the testing conditions they will be at.

For this reason, the use of these sensors in the Smart Citizen Station is tailored to each use and adapted to the calibration needs of the deployment. Characterisation techniques based on manufacturer data and physical models (i.e. classical linear regression using sensor sensitivity, span and zero) require a big development effort in order to characterise the sensor behaviour that, in the case of low-cost sensors, is affected by a wide variety of external factors such as temperature, humidity and pollutant cross-sensitivity, each of which imply a larger characterisation effort and that can\u2019t be fully represented in a controlled setting. On the other hand, statistical models are able to generate models that describe the sensor behaviour in a mathematical way, but they need to be properly adjusted with large amounts of test data, preferably in the actual deployment site. This approach can be applied per sensor, or to a batch of sensors, assuming that the inter-sensor variation is low or that they can be normalised. In the case of deploying the sensors in different locations, the conditions of these sites should be sufficiently similar to those when the model was generated, since many models won\u2019t be able to extrapolate well, or account for effects they have not seen (i.e. temperature gradients, specific pollutants, etc). How much is \u200bsufficiently similar\u200b, depends on the type of model and it is not easy to determine and, since this is not often assessed easily, researchers suggest ( 5 , 6 ) that a co-location prior to and post data acquisition with reference sensors should be carried out. In any case, the development of these models highly depends on the amount and quality of the data obtained from both: sensor data and reference data. In the case of reference data 6 have pointed out that reference stations can deviate up to 15% from the actual pollutant concentration, but this has not been taken into account in this study. Since co-location possibilities could be limited, two options are compared for the calibration of these sensors: a specific on-site calibration with sensor co-location, aiming to calibrate the sensors with the data from that period; and a general model approach, in which all the co-location tests from the different sensors deployed are input into a statistical model that aims to describe the global behaviour. Whether these methods are able to generalise or not, it's yet to be answered, and it's probably to be defined for each use case in particular.","title":"Open questions"},{"location":"Components/sensors/air/Electrochemical%20Sensors/#results","text":"A whole section of the electrochemical sensors validation is available in the iSCAPE D7.8 report on Sensor monitoring experiences and technological innovations 4 .","title":"Results"},{"location":"Components/sensors/air/Electrochemical%20Sensors/#references","text":"The use of electrochemical sensors for monitoring urban air quality in low-cost, high-density networks - M.I.

There is a wide range of possibilities in the market, and our pick was the INVENSENSE (now TDK) ICS43432 : a tiny digital MEMs microphone with I2S output. There is an extensive documentation at TDK's website coming from the former and we would recommend to review the nicely put documents for those interested in the topic. Image credit: Invensense ICS43432 Hardware \u00b6 The MEMs microphone comes with a transducer element which converts the sound pressure into electric signals. The sound pressure reaches the transducer through a hole drilled in the package and the transducer's signal is sent to an ADC which provides with a signal which can be pulse density modulated (PDM) or in I2S format. Since the ADC is already in the microphone, we have an all-digital audio capture path to the processor and it\u2019s less likely to pick up interferences from other RF, such as the WiFi, for example. The I2S has the advantage of a decimated output, and since the SAMD21 has an I2S port, this allows us to connect it directly to the microcontroller with no CODEC needed to decode the audio data. Additionally, there is a bandpass filter, which eliminates DC and low frequency components (i.e. at fs = 48kHz, the filter has -3dB corner at 3,7Hz) and high frequencies at 0,5\u00b7fs (-3dB cutoff). Both specifications are important to consider when analysing the data and discarding unusable frequencies. The microphone acoustic response has to be considered as well, with subsequent equalisation in the data treatment in order. Image credit: ICS43432 Datasheet - TDK Invensense I2S Protocol \u00b6 The I2S protocol ( Inter-IC-Sound ) is a serial bus interface which consists of: a bit clock line or Serial Clock ( SCK ), a word clock line or Word Select ( WS ) and a multiplexed Serial Data line ( SD ). The SD is transmitted in two\u2019s complement with MSB first, with a 24-bit word length in the microphone we picked. The WS is used to indicate which channel is being transmitted (left or right). In the case of the ICS43432, there is an additional pin which corresponds with the L/R, allowing to use the left or right channel to output the signal and the use of stereo configurations. When set to left, the data follows WS\u2019s falling edge and when set to right, the WS\u2019s rising edge. For the SAMD21 processor, there is a well developed I2S library that will take control of this configuration. Image credit: I2S bus specification - Philips Semiconductors The SD line of the I2S protocol is quite delicate at high frequencies and it is largely affected by noise in the path the line follows. If you want to try this at home (for example with an Arduino Zero and an I2S microphone like this one , it is important not to use cables in this line and to connect the output pin directly to the board, to avoid having interfaces throughout the SD line. One interesting way to see this is that every time the line sees a medium change, part of it will be reflected and part will be transmitted, just like any other wave. This means that introducing a cable for the line will provoke at least three medium changes and a potential signal quality loss much higher than a direct connection. Apart from this point, the I2S connection is pretty straight forward and it is reasonably easy to retrieve data from the line and start playing around with some FFT analysis.

The ICS43432 has a clear non-linear response, which is specified in it's datasheet and is characterised in an anechoic chamber: Image credit: Invensense ICS43432 Test setup \u00b6 SCK side 1 x microphone installed in Arduino Zero (alternating Invensense and Knowles), at h = 1,2m Instrumentation side 1 x Speaker at 4m distance from the microphone at h = 1,2m 1 x Microphone 1 x Class I sonometer for double point test Noise floor \u00b6 The noise floor of the microphone in this test setup is of 35,5 dB / 30,1 dBA Spectrum response \u00b6 The results for this characterisation, for different SPLs are shown below: The microphone's spectrum response is not dependent on the SPL, but only on the frequency. The above response is corrected in the Smart Citizen Kit on real time. A double point validation is performed on both microphones, from the SCK1.5 and the SCK2.0 (onwards), yielding the following results ( the results below do not show any equalisation ): Finally, if comparing these with the thresholds, in dBA scale IEC 61672-1 , without accounting for the previous equalisation: Which yields a very good linearity off-the-shelf over the common urban frequency range (below 2000Hz). Sensor Considerations \u00b6 There are some known limitations that need to be taken into account when performing noise measurements with the SCK: The microphone is not isolated in any way from humidity, dust or particles. These can affect the readings and provoke clipping in the readings (absurdly high readings). Up to version 0.9.7 of the firmware, there was a problem in the equalisation tables that provoked low frequencies to be amplified. The fact that the microphone is surface mounted on a PCB can make that certain frequencies resonate on the board and get amplified. Noise measurement basic knowledge \u00b6 Real-world sound pressure levels (SPL) travelling around in the air are not fully perceived by our ears. Image credit: Human hearing - DSP Guide There are several studies and models of what we actually perceive which yield several types of the so called weighting functions . Some of them have been standarised for the purpose of SPL measurement, finding different types like A-weighting (the most common one), B-weighting, D (both in disuse) and others. In the frequency domain, they look like this: Image credit: A-weighting - Wikipedia Even if the are high sound pressure levels floating around in the air, we might not hear them just because of the frequency they are at. Normally humans can hear from something around 20Hz to 20kHz, although most adults might not hear anything in out-of-laboratory conditions above 15kHz. Some animals though, can perceive a great range of frequencies , and for example mouses can hear up to 80kHz. Because of all this, the very first thing we would like to do is to be able to perform weighting on the samples we measure. The I2S microphone is interesting in order to understand sources of urban noise pollution since it provides us with a raw SPL buffer we can play with. As well, we can obtain dBA levels (SPL with a-weighting correction) by processing this buffer in several ways and calculate the RMS level of the resulting signal. Signal processing \u00b6 This is the whole signal treatment process we use for the I2S microphone ICS43432. We will have a look at windowing and its use in future sections, as well as its implementation in the SAMD21 Cortex M0+ for our firmware. Signal acquisition Windowing FFT Spectrum Normalisation Equalisation A-weighting RMS calculation Calculations A note with the calculations on the microphone can be found here About sampling periods A note with the sampling periods on the microphone can be found here For the purists Being mathematical purist, there is yet another possibility for this procedure using convolution in time domain, which is covered below, although not implemented. RMS and FFT algorithm simplified \u00b6 In the previous section we introduced the concept of weighting and our interest on calculating the sound pressure level in different scales. Normally, SPL is expressed in RMS levels, or root mean square . This is nothing more than a modified arithmetic average, where each term of the expression is added in its square form. We then take the square root of all the average: x = {\\sqrt{x_1^2+x_2^2+...+x_N^2 \\over N}} x = {\\sqrt{x_1^2+x_2^2+...+x_N^2 \\over N}} The interesting thing about the RMS level, is that it expresses an average signal level throughout the signal, and it actually relates to the peak level of sinusoid wave by \u221a2. Therefore, it is a very interesting way to express average levels for signals and for that reason, it's the common standard used. Image credit: Sine wave parameters- Wikipedia Now that we know how to calculate the RMS level of our signal, let's go into something more interesting: how do we actually perform the weighting? Well, if you recall the previous section, when we talked about hearing, we were talking about the different hearing capabilities in terms of frequencies (in humans, mouses, beluga whales... ). Therefore, something interesting to know about our signal is its frequency content , so that we are able to perform the weighting. For this purpose, we have the FFT algorithm . FFT stands for Fast Fourier Transform , and it's an algorithm capable of performing a Fourier Transform in a simplified and efficient way (that's where the fast comes in). What it does in a detailed mathematical way is something quite complicated with the details; but being practical, it is basically a convertion between the signal in time domain and its frequency domain components. Interestingly, this process is reversible and the other way around it is called IFFT ( I for Inverse ). Image credit: Smart Citizen In the example above, things in the time domain get a bit messy, but in the frequency domain we can clearly see the composition of two sine waves of the same amplitude of roughly 40Hz and 120Hz. The FFT algorithm hence helps us digest the information contained in a signal in a more visually understandable way. For this introduction, let's move on to what we actually want to do: the much anticipated weighting . At this point, our task is fairly easy: we just have to multiply both: our signal in the frequency domain with the weighting function and that's it! If we have a look at the figure below, in the time and frequency domain, the signals look like this: Image credit: Smart Citizen This example shows how our ears are only capable of perceiving the signal in red, but the actual sound components are in blue -- being much higher in the amplitude spectrum. If you want to get into the thick of it, here you have the actual implementation in Matlab/Octave of the A-weighting function that we'll use in the SCK V2.0. Signal windowing \u00b6 In this section we are going to describe how we have to pre process our signals in order to obtain the results in the manner we are expecting. These are very important steps in our processing chain, since the FFT algorithms -or convolution FIR Filters- won't be able to cope with our system's limitations. These limitations might not be obvious at the beginning, but you really don't want to ignore them while designing your system, since they'll invalidate many of your measurements. The very first of these limitations, is the fact that our microphone is, in fact, taking discrete samples of the ambient noise surrounding it. This means that, from the very beginning, we are missing some pieces of information and we will never be able to process them. For the purpose of our analysis, we don't need to sample continuosly and this situation is easily bypassed. Image credit: NUTAQ - Signal processing Discrete sampling has two main consequences for us: the first one is that we are taking samples once every 1/f_s 1/f_s , where f_s f_s is the sampling frequency. Normal audio systems sample at 44,1kHz, but this number might vary depending on the application. If you remember this chart , you might be wondering why we have to sample at such a high frequency. Image credit: Signal acquisition - Adinstruments Nyquist sampling criterion states that at a minimum, we have to sample at double the maximum frequency we want to analyse . Since humans hearing has a limited frequency range that goes up to 20kHz in some cases, it is reasonable to use something around 40kHz. With this, the Nyquist criterion solves the so called aliasing problem , in which several sinusoid signals could fit the same sampling pattern if the number of samples is too low: Image credit: Wikipedia - Aliasing The second of the discrete sampling limitation comes from the amount of samples we are able to handle at a time . Normally, this is due to memory limitations in the RAM. Nevertheless, it is not useful to handle buffers that are too long , since at some point, the increase of buffer length does not provide any additional information. Buffer length requirements in our case come from the minimum frequency we want to sample, which is around 20Hz . Doing some quick math, we need 0,05s worth of sample buffer, which at 44,1kHz is roughly 2200 samples . This is equally too many samples, considering that each could be allocated as a uint8_t , taking up to 16kB just for the raw buffer! This is where signal windowing kicks in. Imagine that we have a very-low-frequency sinusoid and that we are not able to sample completely the whole sine wave, due to buffer limitations. By definition, our system is assuming that the discrete samples we measure are constantly being repeated in the environment, one after the other: Image credit: Smart Citizen When we take the FFT of this signal, we see undesired frequencies that make our frequency spectrum invalid. This is called spectral leakage and it's mitigated by the use of windows (math funcions, not the OS). These windows operate by smoothing the edges of our measurement and preventing the jumps in the signal helping the FFT algorithm to properly analyse the signals. Image credit: Smart Citizen With the use of signal windowing , more specifically with the use of the hamming window , we are then able to reduce the amount of samples needed to roughly 1000 samples. Now we are down to 50% of the memory allocation needed without windowing . You can see the effect on the RMS relative errors in the image below, where the trend of the Hann (another common window) and the Hamming treated buffers, with respect to the frequency tends to stabilise much more quickly than the raw buffers. Image credit: Smart Citizen There is a wide range of functions to use and the decision depends on your application. For audio applications, the most common ones are the Hann, Hamming, and Blackmann. We chose the Hamming because it's trend is to stabilise a bit more quickly than the rest, although the differencies are minimal. For reference, there is a very interesting description of all these phenomena in this article , where you'll find a more mathematical approach. Signal Equalisation \u00b6 The equalisation process basically tries to correct the microphone response and make it linear. This is because the microphone responds by amplifying some frequencies more than other and we compensate this. To do so, we performed tests in an anechoic chamber and we extracted [this equalisation table]( https://github.com/fablabbcn/smartcitizen-kit-21/blob/master/sam/src/SckSoundTables.h#L18-L21 . This table matches roughly the response of the microphone, but also some other resonances from the urban board. Info This multiplicative factor goes very much in line with the ICS43432 datasheet, although with additional noise components. Extra ball: Filtering and convolution \u00b6 What if we don't like the FFT algorithm and we only want to obtain a dBA or dBC results? There is a fairly simple solution to this problem, and it's called filtering . Filtering is a very common technique in signal acquisition that eliminates some frequency components of the raw signal. Examples of filters you very likely have heard of are low-pass, high-pass and band-pass filters . These only let pass the low, high or a defined interval range of frequencies, mostly cancelling out the rest. In the frequency domain, they basicly multiply the spectrum of our signal with its filter spectrum. Exactly what we have done with the weighting. Image credit: Norwegian Creations First, it is important to get a glimpse of the math behind the filters and why they do their magic. And for this, the most important thing we need to know is called convolution . Image credit: River Trail For the purpose of audio analysis , let's consider we have an input vector, a filter kernel and an output vector. Our input vector can be the raw audio signal we have captured, being the output signal the result of the convolution operation. The filter kernel is the characteristic of the filter and will be, for this example, a one dimension array. What the convolution operation is going to do, in a very very very simplified way , is to sweep through the input sample and multiply each component with it's corresponding filter kernel component, then sum the results and put them in the corresponding output sample. If we put some math notation and call x[n] to the input vector, h[n] to the filter kernel and y[n] to the output vector, it all ends up looking like this: Image credit: DSP Guide Now, the most interesting thing of all this theory is that convolution and multiplication are equivalent operations when we jump from the time to the frequency domain . This means that multiplication in time domain equals to convolution in frequency domain, and more importantly for us, convolution in the time domain, equals to multiplication in the frequency domain . To sum up, the relationship between both domains would look like: Image credit: SmartCitizen Therefore, what we could do is to define a custom filter function and apply it via convolution to our input buffer. This is basically a FIR filter , where FIR stands for Finite Impulse Response . There is another type of filters called IIR , where IIR stands for Infinite impulse response . The difference between them is that FIR uses convolution and IIR uses recursion . The concept of recursion is very simple and it's nothing else than a simplification of the convolution, given that in the convolution algorithm, there are many recursive operations that we repeat over an over and we can implement into a smarter algorithm. Normally, IIR filters are more efficient in terms of speed and memory , but we need to specify a series of coefficients, and it's tricky, if not impossible, to create a custom filter response. Image credit: DSP Guide So finally! How can we avoid using the FFT algorithm to extract the desired frequency content of a signal and recreate the signal without it? Sounds complex, but now we know that we can use a FIR filter , with a custom frequency response and apply it via convolution to our input buffer. As simple as that. The custom frequency response, with the proper math, can be optained by applying the IFFT algorithm to the desired frequency response (for example, the A-weighting function). You can have a look to this example if you want to create a custom filter function in octave , with A or C weighting and implement it to a FIR filter in C++.

Apart from this point, the I2S connection is pretty straight forward and it is reasonably easy to retrieve data from the line and start playing around with some FFT analysis.","title":"I2S Protocol"},{"location":"Components/sensors/air/Noise/#manufacturer-specifications","text":"Parameter Value EIN (dB) - Equivalent input noise 29 Acoustic Dynamic Range (dB) 87 AOP - Acoustic overload point (dB) 116 Full Scale digital (dB SPL) 120 BIT length (-) 24 Sensitivity at 94 dBSPL 1kHz (dBFS) -26","title":"Manufacturer specifications"},{"location":"Components/sensors/air/Noise/#evaluation","text":"The sensor is calibrated in an anechoic chamber with a reference microphone to obtain sensor characteristics.

Image credit: Human hearing - DSP Guide There are several studies and models of what we actually perceive which yield several types of the so called weighting functions . Some of them have been standarised for the purpose of SPL measurement, finding different types like A-weighting (the most common one), B-weighting, D (both in disuse) and others. In the frequency domain, they look like this: Image credit: A-weighting - Wikipedia Even if the are high sound pressure levels floating around in the air, we might not hear them just because of the frequency they are at. Normally humans can hear from something around 20Hz to 20kHz, although most adults might not hear anything in out-of-laboratory conditions above 15kHz. Some animals though, can perceive a great range of frequencies , and for example mouses can hear up to 80kHz. Because of all this, the very first thing we would like to do is to be able to perform weighting on the samples we measure. The I2S microphone is interesting in order to understand sources of urban noise pollution since it provides us with a raw SPL buffer we can play with. As well, we can obtain dBA levels (SPL with a-weighting correction) by processing this buffer in several ways and calculate the RMS level of the resulting signal.","title":"Noise measurement basic knowledge"},{"location":"Components/sensors/air/Noise/#signal-processing","text":"This is the whole signal treatment process we use for the I2S microphone ICS43432.

Normally, SPL is expressed in RMS levels, or root mean square . This is nothing more than a modified arithmetic average, where each term of the expression is added in its square form. We then take the square root of all the average: x = {\\sqrt{x_1^2+x_2^2+...+x_N^2 \\over N}} x = {\\sqrt{x_1^2+x_2^2+...+x_N^2 \\over N}} The interesting thing about the RMS level, is that it expresses an average signal level throughout the signal, and it actually relates to the peak level of sinusoid wave by \u221a2. Therefore, it is a very interesting way to express average levels for signals and for that reason, it's the common standard used. Image credit: Sine wave parameters- Wikipedia Now that we know how to calculate the RMS level of our signal, let's go into something more interesting: how do we actually perform the weighting? Well, if you recall the previous section, when we talked about hearing, we were talking about the different hearing capabilities in terms of frequencies (in humans, mouses, beluga whales... ). Therefore, something interesting to know about our signal is its frequency content , so that we are able to perform the weighting. For this purpose, we have the FFT algorithm . FFT stands for Fast Fourier Transform , and it's an algorithm capable of performing a Fourier Transform in a simplified and efficient way (that's where the fast comes in). What it does in a detailed mathematical way is something quite complicated with the details; but being practical, it is basically a convertion between the signal in time domain and its frequency domain components. Interestingly, this process is reversible and the other way around it is called IFFT ( I for Inverse ). Image credit: Smart Citizen In the example above, things in the time domain get a bit messy, but in the frequency domain we can clearly see the composition of two sine waves of the same amplitude of roughly 40Hz and 120Hz. The FFT algorithm hence helps us digest the information contained in a signal in a more visually understandable way. For this introduction, let's move on to what we actually want to do: the much anticipated weighting . At this point, our task is fairly easy: we just have to multiply both: our signal in the frequency domain with the weighting function and that's it! If we have a look at the figure below, in the time and frequency domain, the signals look like this: Image credit: Smart Citizen This example shows how our ears are only capable of perceiving the signal in red, but the actual sound components are in blue -- being much higher in the amplitude spectrum. If you want to get into the thick of it, here you have the actual implementation in Matlab/Octave of the A-weighting function that we'll use in the SCK V2.0.","title":"RMS and FFT algorithm simplified"},{"location":"Components/sensors/air/Noise/#signal-windowing","text":"In this section we are going to describe how we have to pre process our signals in order to obtain the results in the manner we are expecting. These are very important steps in our processing chain, since the FFT algorithms -or convolution FIR Filters- won't be able to cope with our system's limitations. These limitations might not be obvious at the beginning, but you really don't want to ignore them while designing your system, since they'll invalidate many of your measurements. The very first of these limitations, is the fact that our microphone is, in fact, taking discrete samples of the ambient noise surrounding it. This means that, from the very beginning, we are missing some pieces of information and we will never be able to process them. For the purpose of our analysis, we don't need to sample continuosly and this situation is easily bypassed. Image credit: NUTAQ - Signal processing Discrete sampling has two main consequences for us: the first one is that we are taking samples once every 1/f_s 1/f_s , where f_s f_s is the sampling frequency. Normal audio systems sample at 44,1kHz, but this number might vary depending on the application. If you remember this chart , you might be wondering why we have to sample at such a high frequency. Image credit: Signal acquisition - Adinstruments Nyquist sampling criterion states that at a minimum, we have to sample at double the maximum frequency we want to analyse . Since humans hearing has a limited frequency range that goes up to 20kHz in some cases, it is reasonable to use something around 40kHz. With this, the Nyquist criterion solves the so called aliasing problem , in which several sinusoid signals could fit the same sampling pattern if the number of samples is too low: Image credit: Wikipedia - Aliasing The second of the discrete sampling limitation comes from the amount of samples we are able to handle at a time . Normally, this is due to memory limitations in the RAM. Nevertheless, it is not useful to handle buffers that are too long , since at some point, the increase of buffer length does not provide any additional information. Buffer length requirements in our case come from the minimum frequency we want to sample, which is around 20Hz . Doing some quick math, we need 0,05s worth of sample buffer, which at 44,1kHz is roughly 2200 samples . This is equally too many samples, considering that each could be allocated as a uint8_t , taking up to 16kB just for the raw buffer! This is where signal windowing kicks in. Imagine that we have a very-low-frequency sinusoid and that we are not able to sample completely the whole sine wave, due to buffer limitations. By definition, our system is assuming that the discrete samples we measure are constantly being repeated in the environment, one after the other: Image credit: Smart Citizen When we take the FFT of this signal, we see undesired frequencies that make our frequency spectrum invalid. This is called spectral leakage and it's mitigated by the use of windows (math funcions, not the OS). These windows operate by smoothing the edges of our measurement and preventing the jumps in the signal helping the FFT algorithm to properly analyse the signals. Image credit: Smart Citizen With the use of signal windowing , more specifically with the use of the hamming window , we are then able to reduce the amount of samples needed to roughly 1000 samples. Now we are down to 50% of the memory allocation needed without windowing . You can see the effect on the RMS relative errors in the image below, where the trend of the Hann (another common window) and the Hamming treated buffers, with respect to the frequency tends to stabilise much more quickly than the raw buffers. Image credit: Smart Citizen There is a wide range of functions to use and the decision depends on your application. For audio applications, the most common ones are the Hann, Hamming, and Blackmann. We chose the Hamming because it's trend is to stabilise a bit more quickly than the rest, although the differencies are minimal. For reference, there is a very interesting description of all these phenomena in this article , where you'll find a more mathematical approach.","title":"Signal windowing"},{"location":"Components/sensors/air/Noise/#signal-equalisation","text":"The equalisation process basically tries to correct the microphone response and make it linear.

There is a fairly simple solution to this problem, and it's called filtering . Filtering is a very common technique in signal acquisition that eliminates some frequency components of the raw signal. Examples of filters you very likely have heard of are low-pass, high-pass and band-pass filters . These only let pass the low, high or a defined interval range of frequencies, mostly cancelling out the rest. In the frequency domain, they basicly multiply the spectrum of our signal with its filter spectrum. Exactly what we have done with the weighting. Image credit: Norwegian Creations First, it is important to get a glimpse of the math behind the filters and why they do their magic. And for this, the most important thing we need to know is called convolution . Image credit: River Trail For the purpose of audio analysis , let's consider we have an input vector, a filter kernel and an output vector. Our input vector can be the raw audio signal we have captured, being the output signal the result of the convolution operation. The filter kernel is the characteristic of the filter and will be, for this example, a one dimension array. What the convolution operation is going to do, in a very very very simplified way , is to sweep through the input sample and multiply each component with it's corresponding filter kernel component, then sum the results and put them in the corresponding output sample. If we put some math notation and call x[n] to the input vector, h[n] to the filter kernel and y[n] to the output vector, it all ends up looking like this: Image credit: DSP Guide Now, the most interesting thing of all this theory is that convolution and multiplication are equivalent operations when we jump from the time to the frequency domain . This means that multiplication in time domain equals to convolution in frequency domain, and more importantly for us, convolution in the time domain, equals to multiplication in the frequency domain . To sum up, the relationship between both domains would look like: Image credit: SmartCitizen Therefore, what we could do is to define a custom filter function and apply it via convolution to our input buffer. This is basically a FIR filter , where FIR stands for Finite Impulse Response . There is another type of filters called IIR , where IIR stands for Infinite impulse response . The difference between them is that FIR uses convolution and IIR uses recursion . The concept of recursion is very simple and it's nothing else than a simplification of the convolution, given that in the convolution algorithm, there are many recursive operations that we repeat over an over and we can implement into a smarter algorithm. Normally, IIR filters are more efficient in terms of speed and memory , but we need to specify a series of coefficients, and it's tricky, if not impossible, to create a custom filter response. Image credit: DSP Guide So finally! How can we avoid using the FFT algorithm to extract the desired frequency content of a signal and recreate the signal without it? Sounds complex, but now we know that we can use a FIR filter , with a custom frequency response and apply it via convolution to our input buffer. As simple as that. The custom frequency response, with the proper math, can be optained by applying the IFFT algorithm to the desired frequency response (for example, the A-weighting function). You can have a look to this example if you want to create a custom filter function in octave , with A or C weighting and implement it to a FIR filter in C++.

In a simplified way, it is comprised of two main elements: A SnO 2 substrate that acts as a sensor element A heater element to keep the substrate in an optimal working area The SnO 2 is a chemically sensitive metal oxide which has interactions with molecules to be detected in the target gas. The reactions that can occur on SnO 2 surface are adsorption and catalytic reactions , which basically mean that the gas molecules can be adsorbed onto the surface or can catalyse reactions (trigger or enhance them). They take place at the so called active sites or grain boundaries, which are areas where the grains that constitute the sensor resistance are in contact with the air (e.g. with metallic contacts). Hence, metal oxide substrate is basically a collection of sites at which different molecules can be absorbed and therefore interact in various manners with the species present in the atmosphere: either through catalytic reaction, surface reaction, grain boundary reaction ( among others ). 2 . The sensor element is typically heated to a few hundred degrees (\u00baC) using a small resistive heater . The regions within the sensor can be described as in Peterson et al. 1 : the surface, which interacts with the gas, the bulk, which is unaffected by it, and the particle boundary, which lies in between these two . The particle boundary is situated at a distance from any material exposed to the atmosphere into the sensor that chemical electrostatic effects can propagate (the so called Debye length), and this is related to the material\u2019s physical properties. At high temperatures, oxygen atoms bond onto the boundary, extracting electrons in the process from the semiconductor\u2019s surface region. The oxygen either then directly reacts with ambient gases, or these gases also bond onto the sensor, which causes more charge carriers to be withdrawn or injected into the surface region. All these effects change the sensor resistance and it is measured accordingly in 1 : In the case of the SGX 4514, the detection of the pollution gases is achieved by measuring the sensing resistance of both sensors. In a generic way, we could characterise the sensor resistance as follows: RED sensor resistance decreases in the presence of CO and hydrocarbons. OX sensor resistance increases in the presence of NO 2 . Finally, the chemical reactions within the resistive element are directly related to temperature and follow an Arrhenius equation type of behaviour. Each sensor's type has a different optimal operation temperature, which is translated into different heating powers for the heater element. Depending on the heating power and transition speeds, different reactions can be facilitated and this can lead to positive effects such as sensor clean up or battery compsuption savings, for example, when heated up in a pulsed profile. On the other hand, it can facilitate sensor poisoning or ageing, which highlights the need of proper sensor characterisation. Sensor Calibration \u00b6 The SGX4514 is a low cost sensor originally ment to detect instances or trends of target gas in the atmosphere 4 5 . The applications intended for these sensors are \u2018event sensing\u2018 applications and the level of accuracy required is not necessarily within regulatory standards. Furthermore, these sensors should not be used with safety related issues. However, despite the low cost nature of these sensors, they have been subject of a great deal of research 1 2 3 and have been reported to give considerably good results in field applications. Before delving into the details of sensor calibration, we will try to understand what these sensors are and how they should be handled. Some important definitions are: Sensor baseline resistance : is the resistance that the sensor exhibits when it's not powered Sensor sensitivity : is the resistance variation with variations in the target gas Sensor cross-sensitivity : is the resistance variation with variations of gases other than the target gas Sensor poisoning : an irreversible resistance variation provoked by the reaction of gases other than the target gas Source: Peterson et al. 1 Peterson et al. 1 describes the various types of interactions between atmospheric gases and a MOS sensor surface. In the image above, the leftmost region describes the unpowered behaviour, or base resistance . The three other regions of the diagram describe different processes that actually occur simultaneously to varying degrees. The sensor\u2019s output is the resistance across the whole of the sensor material, which forms a resistor network with contributions from both the bulk and surface regions. The model described in 1 also explains the wide variation in base resistance between individual sensors of the same type, as the random nature of the surface geometry means an equally random network of resistances. This diagram is a two-dimensional representation of a three-dimensional material; in an actual sensor, the sensitive region is spread into the surface with a distance dependent on the grain size and arrangement resulting from the sintering. Each sensor will then have a different resistance in air and how much this baseline resistance changes with the concentration of the target gas will also differ (what we defined above as sensitivity). Therefore to convert from resistance readings to concentration it is necessary to derive a calibration curve for each sensor . This will require measuring the resistances in air and at a number of gas concentrations over the desired range. It is important that the concentrations are in a background of air as Oxygen is needed for the sensor to work correctly. As stated in 2 , the sensor\u2019s response is only partially a function of the amount of gas to which the surface is exposed. Instead, the sensor will have a baseline resistance that is related to the bulk and particle boundary resistance. Because of the random geometry of the granular sensor surface, the baseline resistance will vary between individual sensors. The change in resistance with the change in gas concentration is generally not a linear response. The response can be measured and fitted to a polynomial relationship , with interactions from other metrics such as temperature, humidity and other gases. It has been proved that air flow around the sensor yields better sensor reactivity, and that the usage of PTFE filters also helps reducing cross-sensitivity and sensor poisoning. An important practical consideration with any in situ air quality sensor design is ensuring adequate flow of sampling air through the device. Stale air inside a casing will produce unrepresentative results , and even sensors mounted outside a casing might not get a properly-mixed sample. Source: Peterson et al. 1 Although the deployment of multiple different sensors can compensate for the cross-sensitivity issues in calibration, it cannot eliminate it. MOS sensors can thus be used only in situations where any interfering species can either be measured by other means, or they must be calibrated regularly and used in locations where the background varies in concentration slowly compared with the target gases. As well, the sensor drift over time is an important issue that requires sensor recalibration over time. There are two major factors in the longevity of a sensor\u2019s calibration. The first is the natural degradation of the heater element, which becomes hotter over prolonged use and causes the sensor\u2019s response profile to vary. The second is the effect of slowly-varying interfering gases, which over the course of months shifts the sensor\u2019s baseline. The first problem may have an engineering solution, but the second will involve taking the results of the tests in an artificial atmosphere, identifying the most critical species and either measuring or possibly modelling their likely concentrations during deployments. An analytical approach to counteracting this drift might be \"merging calibrations\", where a sensor is calibrated at the start and end of a four-month campaign, and the coefficients gradually change from one end of the experiment run to the other. Having all this in mind, the sensor calibration we follow is comprised of the following steps: Sensor behaviour characterisation under different temperature profiles Sensor baseline and sensitivity characterisation in controlled conditions Sensor deployment with reference measurements collocation and model calibration The use of deployment campaigns is of utmost importance in order to develop sensor models that are reality proof . With the possibility of collecting the data with the SmartCitizen Platform and the data treatment provided by the Sensor Calibration Framework , we are able to iterate over the different sensor calibration possibilities, ranging from Ordinary Linear Regression or more advanced techniques such as ML models such as LSTMs networks. Field results \u00b6 In this section, we will detail some of the MOS related results obtained during the sensor validation campaigns detailed below: University of Bologna : data collected from 23/January to 13/February.

Therefore, this is just to considered as an use case example and further tests and data should be carried out to train broader models. Metal Oxide Sensors Implementation \u00b6 Heating stage \u00b6 The solution present at Urban Sensor Board V2.0 for MICS-4514 sensor's heaters excitation, pretends to make it compatible with a 3.3V global voltage source. The manufacturer reccomend the following circuit topology, with a global supply voltage of 5V. In the datasheet are collected the electrical nominal conditions for that resistors, in order to operate safely with the heater, without damaging it. Besides that, several other possible conditions could also damage early the heater resistors, like the fact of consider a pure PWM signal, with source 5V and subsequent dutty cycle, as excitation. Even if the frequency is relatively high (100kHz), the resistors are forced to operate briefly with 5V, and this accelerates the destruction of this part of the MICS sensor. So its is possible to provide the nominal voltages for heater resistors from a 3.3V source, if we replace the auxiliar resistors (from recomended topology) with corresponding values, to preserve the total power dissipated and current at same normal operating conditions. Even more, we can upgrade the function of the auxiliar resistors adding a capacitor to form a passive RC filter. In the DC or continuous operation, the capacitor is fully charged and the current is limited by the auxiliar resistor. In AC or pulsed operation, the capacitor can be selected to remove this AC component, and feed the heater resistor with a nearly constant voltage or at least with small variations (<1%). The source for the PWM signal must be buffered, because the resistive load of the system demands currents avobe the SAMD21 can supply. For this purpose, the solution selected is to use a digital hex-inverter buffer, which can drive up to 32mA with each output pin, wich we can paralelize to operate under propper safety factor for the buffer. Simulations \u00b6 The first simulations and given values leads to the selection of the RC components values if we set a PWM frequency around 40 kHz. To evaluate the R part of the filter, is needed to take into account the output resistance of the hex-inverter buffer. Prototypes \u00b6 We build the circuit into a protoboard, with several IC HEX-INV manufacturers, based on the following schematic: The measures are sumarized in the following table, in which we compare four pre-selected devices, which can fit in our application for size an price considerations. Four cases with paralellized inverters, for each device were performed: pasive load 70R test with DC input, and three tests with 10R+Rheater load at DC input, 60% dutty cycle and 30% dutty cycle. The 74LCX04FT(AE) was selected because it has the lowest LOW output level (0.45V,0.22V), which is considered here as the quality (or close to ideal) of the square wave input source. Final implementation \u00b6 The solution implemented in the PCB, has a constant auxilar R (10R+Rout_buff), and constant C (47uF), and also operates at consatant frequency, then, the output power regulation is based on the PWM's dutty cycle. The following circuit represent the implemented schematic. Operation \u00b6 First of all, is needed to know the real implemented Rheater of each sensor (which may vary among devices and time), and can be estimated by measuring the V_heater_* at 100% dutty cycle, then: Where Rint_buff can be aproximated with 4 Ohm resistor. The desired_reference_voltage is function of the desired_power_Rheater and dutty cycle. If we set 80mW we can use the value of the Rheater to obtain desired_reference_voltage through tis formula: (Take into account this resistor has a drift over time, therefore is recomended to take periodic measurements of the value of Rheater itself, and check the output power reachability). With selected parameters, after 2ms of PWM operation, the RC reaches the permanent, and then is recomended to take measurements of V_HEATER_ . The loop can be closed to determine the dutty cycle as function of the difference (desired_reference_voltage \u2013 V_HEATER_ (averaged)). Is recomended to average several samples to remove the AC part of the signal. The measured DC signal has a noise of \u00b120mV peak to peak (with triangular distribution). The sign of the PWM signal is inverted due to the action of the inverter, then, a desired x% dutty is obtained as 100%-x%. As initial PWM aproximation to begin to converge close to the regulated dutty cycle can be obtained through this simplification: References \u00b6 Practical Use of Metal Oxide Semiconductor Gas Sensors for Measuring Nitrogen Dioxide and Ozone in Urban Environments \u21a9 \u21a9 \u21a9 \u21a9 \u21a9 \u21a9 \u21a9 Modelling Of Water Adsorption On SnO 2 Surface \u21a9 \u21a9 \u21a9 MICS-4514 Datasheet \u21a9 Frequently-Asked-Questions-for-MiCS-Gas-Sensors \u21a9 SGX Metal Oxide Gas Sensors - How to use and how they perform \u21a9 Sensors 2017, 17, 1653 \u21a9","title":"About the CO-NO2 MOs"},{"location":"Components/sensors/air/SGX%20MICS/#about-co-no2-metal-oxide-sensors","text":"The SGX Mics is a Metal Oxide Resistive sensor capable of reacting to different substances in the atmosphere. In a simplified way, it is comprised of two main elements: A SnO 2 substrate that acts as a sensor element A heater element to keep the substrate in an optimal working area The SnO 2 is a chemically sensitive metal oxide which has interactions with molecules to be detected in the target gas. The reactions that can occur on SnO 2 surface are adsorption and catalytic reactions , which basically mean that the gas molecules can be adsorbed onto the surface or can catalyse reactions (trigger or enhance them). They take place at the so called active sites or grain boundaries, which are areas where the grains that constitute the sensor resistance are in contact with the air (e.g. with metallic contacts). Hence, metal oxide substrate is basically a collection of sites at which different molecules can be absorbed and therefore interact in various manners with the species present in the atmosphere: either through catalytic reaction, surface reaction, grain boundary reaction ( among others ). 2 . The sensor element is typically heated to a few hundred degrees (\u00baC) using a small resistive heater . The regions within the sensor can be described as in Peterson et al. 1 : the surface, which interacts with the gas, the bulk, which is unaffected by it, and the particle boundary, which lies in between these two . The particle boundary is situated at a distance from any material exposed to the atmosphere into the sensor that chemical electrostatic effects can propagate (the so called Debye length), and this is related to the material\u2019s physical properties. At high temperatures, oxygen atoms bond onto the boundary, extracting electrons in the process from the semiconductor\u2019s surface region. The oxygen either then directly reacts with ambient gases, or these gases also bond onto the sensor, which causes more charge carriers to be withdrawn or injected into the surface region. All these effects change the sensor resistance and it is measured accordingly in 1 : In the case of the SGX 4514, the detection of the pollution gases is achieved by measuring the sensing resistance of both sensors. In a generic way, we could characterise the sensor resistance as follows: RED sensor resistance decreases in the presence of CO and hydrocarbons. OX sensor resistance increases in the presence of NO 2 . Finally, the chemical reactions within the resistive element are directly related to temperature and follow an Arrhenius equation type of behaviour. Each sensor's type has a different optimal operation temperature, which is translated into different heating powers for the heater element. Depending on the heating power and transition speeds, different reactions can be facilitated and this can lead to positive effects such as sensor clean up or battery compsuption savings, for example, when heated up in a pulsed profile. On the other hand, it can facilitate sensor poisoning or ageing, which highlights the need of proper sensor characterisation.","title":"About CO-NO2 Metal Oxide Sensors"},{"location":"Components/sensors/air/SGX%20MICS/#sensor-calibration","text":"The SGX4514 is a low cost sensor originally ment to detect instances or trends of target gas in the atmosphere 4 5 . The applications intended for these sensors are \u2018event sensing\u2018 applications and the level of accuracy required is not necessarily within regulatory standards. Furthermore, these sensors should not be used with safety related issues. However, despite the low cost nature of these sensors, they have been subject of a great deal of research 1 2 3 and have been reported to give considerably good results in field applications. Before delving into the details of sensor calibration, we will try to understand what these sensors are and how they should be handled. Some important definitions are: Sensor baseline resistance : is the resistance that the sensor exhibits when it's not powered Sensor sensitivity : is the resistance variation with variations in the target gas Sensor cross-sensitivity : is the resistance variation with variations of gases other than the target gas Sensor poisoning : an irreversible resistance variation provoked by the reaction of gases other than the target gas Source: Peterson et al. 1 Peterson et al. 1 describes the various types of interactions between atmospheric gases and a MOS sensor surface. In the image above, the leftmost region describes the unpowered behaviour, or base resistance . The three other regions of the diagram describe different processes that actually occur simultaneously to varying degrees. The sensor\u2019s output is the resistance across the whole of the sensor material, which forms a resistor network with contributions from both the bulk and surface regions. The model described in 1 also explains the wide variation in base resistance between individual sensors of the same type, as the random nature of the surface geometry means an equally random network of resistances. This diagram is a two-dimensional representation of a three-dimensional material; in an actual sensor, the sensitive region is spread into the surface with a distance dependent on the grain size and arrangement resulting from the sintering. Each sensor will then have a different resistance in air and how much this baseline resistance changes with the concentration of the target gas will also differ (what we defined above as sensitivity). Therefore to convert from resistance readings to concentration it is necessary to derive a calibration curve for each sensor . This will require measuring the resistances in air and at a number of gas concentrations over the desired range. It is important that the concentrations are in a background of air as Oxygen is needed for the sensor to work correctly. As stated in 2 , the sensor\u2019s response is only partially a function of the amount of gas to which the surface is exposed. Instead, the sensor will have a baseline resistance that is related to the bulk and particle boundary resistance. Because of the random geometry of the granular sensor surface, the baseline resistance will vary between individual sensors. The change in resistance with the change in gas concentration is generally not a linear response. The response can be measured and fitted to a polynomial relationship , with interactions from other metrics such as temperature, humidity and other gases. It has been proved that air flow around the sensor yields better sensor reactivity, and that the usage of PTFE filters also helps reducing cross-sensitivity and sensor poisoning. An important practical consideration with any in situ air quality sensor design is ensuring adequate flow of sampling air through the device. Stale air inside a casing will produce unrepresentative results , and even sensors mounted outside a casing might not get a properly-mixed sample. Source: Peterson et al. 1 Although the deployment of multiple different sensors can compensate for the cross-sensitivity issues in calibration, it cannot eliminate it. MOS sensors can thus be used only in situations where any interfering species can either be measured by other means, or they must be calibrated regularly and used in locations where the background varies in concentration slowly compared with the target gases. As well, the sensor drift over time is an important issue that requires sensor recalibration over time. There are two major factors in the longevity of a sensor\u2019s calibration. The first is the natural degradation of the heater element, which becomes hotter over prolonged use and causes the sensor\u2019s response profile to vary. The second is the effect of slowly-varying interfering gases, which over the course of months shifts the sensor\u2019s baseline. The first problem may have an engineering solution, but the second will involve taking the results of the tests in an artificial atmosphere, identifying the most critical species and either measuring or possibly modelling their likely concentrations during deployments. An analytical approach to counteracting this drift might be \"merging calibrations\", where a sensor is calibrated at the start and end of a four-month campaign, and the coefficients gradually change from one end of the experiment run to the other. Having all this in mind, the sensor calibration we follow is comprised of the following steps: Sensor behaviour characterisation under different temperature profiles Sensor baseline and sensitivity characterisation in controlled conditions Sensor deployment with reference measurements collocation and model calibration The use of deployment campaigns is of utmost importance in order to develop sensor models that are reality proof . With the possibility of collecting the data with the SmartCitizen Platform and the data treatment provided by the Sensor Calibration Framework , we are able to iterate over the different sensor calibration possibilities, ranging from Ordinary Linear Regression or more advanced techniques such as ML models such as LSTMs networks.","title":"Sensor Calibration"},{"location":"Components/sensors/air/SGX%20MICS/#field-results","text":"In this section, we will detail some of the MOS related results obtained during the sensor validation campaigns detailed below: University of Bologna : data collected from 23/January to 13/February.

The framework allows downloading data from the Smart Citizen API or other sources , as well as to load local csv files. Then, different data explorations options are readily available, and not limited to them due to the great visualisation tools in python . Finally, you can generate html, or pdf reports for sharing the results. Examples Check the examples in the Github Repository Organise your data Handling a lot of different sensors can be at times difficult to organise and have traceability. For this, we created the concept of test , which groups a set of devices, potentially from various sources. This is convenient since metadata can be addeed to the test instance describing, for instance, what was done, the calibration data for the device, necessary preprocessing for the data, etc. This test can be later loaded in a separate analysis session, modified or expanded, keeping all the data findable. Some example metadata that can be stored would be: Test Location, date and author Kit type and reference Sensor calibration data or reference Availability of reference equipment measurement and type A brief schema of the test structure is specified below: Check the guide Check the guide on how to organise sensor data Clean sensor data Sensor data never comes clean and tidy in the real world. For this reason, data can be cleaned with simple, and not that simple algorithms for later processing. Several functions are already implemented (filtering with convolution, Kalman filters , anomaly detection, ...), and more can be implemented in the source files. Model sensor data Low cost sensor data needs calibration, with more or less complex regression algorithms. This can be done at times with a simple linear regression, but it is not the only case. Sensors generally present non-linearities, and linear models might not be the bests at handling the data robustly. For this, a set of models ir rightly implemented, using the power of common statistics and machine learning frameworks such as sci-kit learn , tensorflow , keras , and stats models . Guidelines on sensor development Check our guidelines on sensor deployment to see why this is important in some cases. Batch analysis Automatisation of all this tools can be very handy at times, since we want to spend less time programming analysis tools than actually doing analysis. Tasks can be programmed in batch to be processed automatically by the framework in an autonomous way. For instance, some interesting use cases of this could be: Downloading data from many devices, do something (clean it) and export it to .csv Downloading data and generate plots, extract metrics and generate reports for many devices Testing calibration models with different hyperparameters, modeling approaches and datasets Share data One important aspect of our research is to share the data so that others can work on it, and build on top of our results, validate the conclusions or simply disseminate the work done. For this, integration with zenodo is provided to share datasets and reports: Have a look at the features within the framework: Tools to retrieve data from the Smart Citizen's API or to load them from local sources (in csv format, compatible with the SCK SD card data) A data handling framework based on the well known Pandas package An exploratory data analysis tools to study sensor behaviour and correlations with different types of plots A sensor model calibration toolset with classical statistical methods such as linear regression, ARIMA, SARIMA-X, as well as more modern Machine Learning techniques with the use of LSTM networks, RF (Random Forest), SVR (Support Vector Regression) models for sequential data prediction and forecasting Methods to statistically validate and study the performance of these models, export and store them As a bonus, an interface to convert the python objects into the statistical analysis language R Info Check the guide on how to set it up here Loading and managing the data \u00b6 Data can be downloaded from the SmartCitizen API with the KIT IDs or using csv.

Exploratory data analysis \u00b6 The device's data can be explored visually with different types of plots. It can also be generated in batch with descriptor files, as shown in the guide . Some of the functionalities implemented are: Time series visualisation Correlation plot and pairs plot Correlogram Heatmaps Violin plots This section uses interactive plotting frameworks as Plotly and the well known matplotlib to serve different exploratory analysis tools. Data models \u00b6 The data models section includes tools to prepare, train and evaluate models coming from different devices within a test in order to calibrate your sensors. It provides an interface with common statistics and machine learning frameworks such as sci-kit learn , tensorflow , keras , and stats models . These frameworks provide tools to perform: Pre-processing stage: Outliers detection with Holt-Winters methods (triple exponential smoothing) and XGBoost Regressors Data study and analysis for multicollinearity and autocorrelation in order to determine significant variables and avoid model overfit with non-significant exogenous variables Trend decomposition and seasonality analysis Model stage Baseline model estimations in order to assess minimum targets for model quality (using naive regression models) Ordinary Linear Regression techniques for univariate and multivariate linear and non-linear independent variables ARIMA-X (Autorregresive, Integrated, Moving Average) models with exogenous variables using Box-Jenkis parameter selection methods Supervised learning techiques: Single and multiple layers LSTM (Long-Thort Term Memory) networks with configurable structure Random Forest and Support Vector methods for regression An example of the model is shown below for the estimation of the SGX4514 CO with the use of the rest of the Kit's available sensor, using a single layer LSTM network only two weeks of training: Depending on the model selected, different validation techniques are implemented, in order to verify models' assumptions and avoid data misinterpretation (i.e. Durbin Watson or Jacque Bera test for linear regression).

We follow this sensor calibration procedure , which can be split into three stages: Behaviour assesment : in laboratory conditions, serving as base testing for assessing general sensor behaviour. Characterisation : also in laboratory conditions, assess generic sensor parameters as sensitivity, zero and span. Modelisation with real world deployment : including other variables such as environmental factors and sensor cross-sensitivity. Each of these stages apply differently depending on the type of sensor. For instance the electrochemical sensors present in the Station are already characterised by the manufacturer, while the old SGX MICS4514 Metal Oxyde Sensors in the Urban Board of the Smart Citizen Kit are not. The different characteristics of these sensors make different calibration approaches to be carried out. Base calibration parameters need to be determined in controlled conditions. In this stage, the aim would be to find parameters such as: Sensor sensitivity : the sensor response per each ppm of target pollutant in nominal conditions Zero : the sensor reading in zero air (pure air at 25degC). Sensor response (t 90 ) Sensor range : maximum and minimum readings for the sensor Finally, after this initial calibration assessment, it is critical to gather as much data as possible from long term sensor deployments . These deployments should aim to cover the widest range of sensor exposure conditions, in order to generate robust models. While dealing with low cost sensors this stage is very important, as it is detailed in the sections below. These sensor deployments serve for two main purposes: to generate quantitative classification methods that can classify the air quality in predefined ranges (i.e. 'poor', 'fair', good'); and to generate predictive qualitative models for more accurate values. Either of them need large amounts of data if the models are aimed to be representative. Additionally, by the mere nature of the data and the sensors themselves, these models would need to be: Robusts to noise Capable of learning non-linear relationships Handle multivariate inputs Capable of learning temporal dependence These needs make machine learning methods great canditates for modeling the data. These methods are implemented in the Sensor Analysis Framework, as well as other more traditional linear methods. The combination of these algorithms with large amounts of data gathered during, for instance, the iScape project, offers a great opportunity to demonstrate the use of low cost sensors for air quality monitoring. Smart Citizen Kits \u00b6 Due to their construction, low-cost metal oxyde sensors suffer from high levels of spread in their baseline resistance and sensitivity. As well, these sensors are generally reactive to other pollutants in the atmosphere, with a low selectivity of the actual target pollutant and drifts in their behaviour can be seen after some weeks of exposure. As well, metal oxyde sensors show short and long term drifts in their calibrations. Ideally, a sensor characterisation in laboratory conditions is needed to assess sensitiviy, baseline resistances sensor-to-sensor spread, aiming to obtain normalising factors for each sensor or group of sensors. Even if possible, the variability of the sensor behaviour during the deployment stage, makes the individual characterisation and calibration of the Metal Oxyde sensors unrealistic. For this reason, indicative measurements are to be expected from this type of low cost sensors. More information about the sensors present in the urban board of the SCK can be found in this section . Smart Citizen Stations \u00b6 Electrochemical sensors These sensors can achieve significant accuracy, but they require a particular data post-processing that combines the measurement at the sensor electrodes with the sensor characterisation on the factory as well as other environmental parameters as air temperature and relative humidity (i.e. absolute humidity). Luckily the manufacturer of these sensors, Alphasense, provides us with that reference data. However, the complexity of the operations performed can not be done inside the sensing device as it uses advanced operations as well as historical data from the same device. For that reason, the data needs to be post processed using the Sensors Analysis Framework. The algorithm is in a beta stage and later it will be applied automatically on the data once it arrives at the platform. More details can be found in the Electrochemical sensor baseline methodology Section . This process doesn't require any on-site reference data but requires the data to be processed using the manufacturer calibration reference per sensor as well as other environmental values as temperature and humidity. PM sensor The selected PM sensor is internally characterised by the manufacturer and, it's readings are currently being evaluated. Preliminarily, the measurements can be as well improved when reference data is available, as some have noted that the PM sensors can be affected by relative humidity.

TL;DR Check the developers ready API Documentation Data Ingestion Flow \u00b6 As already described in the Supported Assets sections, above, the Platforms supports multiple sensor types and even data coming from other platforms. On the following section, we describe all the features supported when it comes to sending data to the platform. Ingestion protocols \u00b6 Two protocols are supported for data to be sent to the platform: MQTT and HTTP MQTT is the one used by constrained devices as the Citizen Sensors and the Living Lab Stations. It allows the devices to post data to the platform after they are registered. It also allows them to receive configuration options (i.e. sensors reading interval) and report errors (i.e. sensors are malfunctioning). HTTP is aimed at applications publishing data to the platform (i.e. an existing sensors platform that also wants to make all the data available to the platform). This API gives access to all the platform functionalities as it is part of the core Smart Citizen API. Over this API we are not just limited to publish data but to register new devices or even users. oth protocols support transport encryption with TLS to ensure secure communication between the client and the server over the Internet. Authorisation and authentication \u00b6 Knowing who posts what is a serious problem when it comes to hundreds of sensor data being published per minute. Constrained hardware devices using the MQTT API use a unique device token given to the device every time is registered on the platform. The token authenticates the devices against the platform, and it can be expired at any time to prevent a device to keep publishing. Instead, the HTTP API supports authentication using an OAuth2 or a private token. Both mechanisms work at a user level allowing a single process to manage all the devices created by a user. Kits blueprints \u00b6 Each device sensors configuration needs to be previously registered on the platform to ensure each datapoint published is associated with the required metadata. This information is called a Kit blueprint. The minimal blueprint includes all the necessary data that a user might provide to create a Kit. It is composed of Components, and those can reuse existing Sensors and Measurements. Sensors are the hardware or software components that record the data. Measurements are descriptions of what the sensors are recording. Data Storage \u00b6 Once the steps above are completed data is stored in a database cluster performing asynchronous masterless replication to ensure data backup and availability. Each datapoint is stored with the following items: Component : A reference to the component type that generated the datapoint. Device : A reference to the device that generated the datapoint. Raw Data : The datapoint as received to the platform Processed Data : The datapoint after applying post processing, when implemented. Timestamp : The time the datapoint was generated. Once stored historical data available via the Smart Citizen API. All the other services, as the Smart Citizen Webpage, access the data from there. The API also exposes a method where data is processed to a CSV file and email to the user. That allows loading the data offline to any software capable of dealing with CSV files (i.e. Microsoft Excel, MATLAB, etc.)","title":"Smart Citizen API"},{"location":"Data/Smart%20Citizen%20API/#smart-citizen-api","text":"The cloud-based data engine supporting: data ingestion, aggregation and retrieving.

This guide will show the calibration process and particularities for using the Sensirion SCD30 CO2 sensor with the Smart Citizen Kit. Manufacturer information \u00b6 Sensirion provides a lot of information in their applications note website for the SCD30 CO2. The datasheet can be found here . Setup \u00b6 If you are using the SEEED Studio breakout , the sensor can be directly connected to the Auxiliary connector on the data board, using a 4-wire grove cable . Sensor can operate in two modes for finding it's reference value. For both of these modes have customizable reading intervals that affect power consumption and response time. Finally, a temperature correction can be applied for electronics temperature build-up. All the commands below are accessed by: SCD30 CO2: Options: interval [2-1000 (seconds)] autocal [on/off] calfactor [400-2000 (ppm)] caltemp [newTemp/off] pressure The procedure for setting up the sensor goes as follows (more information in Low power mode AN ): Reading interval \u00b6 The SCD30 can have different internal reading intervals, independent from the SCK's interval . A larger reading interval will reduce power consumption, but it will increase response time. By default, the reading interval is 2s. A good reading interval for reducing substantially power consumption is 15s. Below there is a table derived from the manufacturer's application notes that can guide in the reading interval setup process: Interval (s) Consumption (mA) Response time (t63 - s) 2 19 20 15 6.5 72 30 6.5 145 More information can be found in the low power mode application note . To control this, and set it up to 15s: control scd30 interval 15 To check the current interval: control scd30 interval Calibration \u00b6 The SCD30 can work in two main modes: ASC (automatic self-calibration) or FRC (forced re-calibration). They are both described in the Field calibration for SCD30 AN . Image source: Sensirion Additionally, there is a possibility to calibrate the temperature readings with an external sensor for correcting the SCD30 internal temperature corrections. ASC \u00b6 Sensor by default is set in ASC mode. In this mode, the sensor looks for a clean environment over a 1-3 weeks period of time, for at least 1h of clean air per day . Considerations: Do not unplug the sensors during the first week period of ASC Place it in a place where you know there is going to be a clean air composition during that period. Indoor environments is not always the best for this purpose Do not trust the initial values, as the self-calibration algorithm might have not found proper values yet There is no way for us to know wether the self-calibration process has satisfactory values. Our understanding is that the internal SCD30 algorithm converges after a period of time, but there is no indication whatsoever of the quality of the readings (see insights section for more information) To turn it on: control scd30 autocal on Or off: control scd30 autocal off FRC \u00b6 To activate FRC mode, we need to provide an external CO2 concentration in ppm. FRC calibration takes place inmediately, and it can be do multiple times at aribtrary intervals. Before applying it, run the sensor for at least 2 minutes in the desired environment. Unstable environments Take into account the response time of the sensor (with 2s it's t63=20s). If the environment in which you are taking readings it's too unstable, do not apply the FRC. First, make sure both reference and SCD30 sensors are stable: monitor scd30 co2 To stop the monitor, just press Enter . Secondly, feed the external reading into the sensor. The value needs to be between 400ppm and 2000ppm. For instance, for a value of 450ppm: control scd30 calfactor 450 Reference value range The reference value needs to be between 400ppm and 2000ppm. After applying this value, ASC will be disabled automatically and readings will be inmediately corrected to the new value. Temperature correction \u00b6 An external temperature sensor can also be used to compensate the self-heating of the SCD30 board. A temperature correction can be supplied with the caltemp command. First, read the temperature from the SCD30, to verify it's lower than the reference sensor. read scd30 temp If it is, then feed the external temperature value (for instance, 15 \u00baC): control scd30 caltemp 15 After this, the sensor will stabilise and converge to the new temperature correction reading after a while.

For this reason, we have developed a functionality to process the data in batches, defining the tasks to perform in a json descriptor file. The descriptor file can be placed in the src/tasks directory (or any, actually). An example of how to run it is shown in examples/batch_analysis.ipynb : # Load the object from src.models.batch import batch_analysis\", tasks_file = '../tasks/batch.json'\", batch_session = batch_analysis(tasks_file, verbose = True) # Run the analysis batch_session.run() Functionality \u00b6 These tasks are intended to automatise data analysis tasks as the following: Load, process and export processed data Generate models and apply them, extracting metrics and comparing if they extrapolate to different set of sensors in different datasets, without having to run extra code Make plots for different metrics in an automatic way, and export their renders Workflow \u00b6 Json task description \u00b6 The descriptor file loaded is a json containing keys for each task to be run. Several tasks can be included and will be run consecutively: { \"TASK_1\":{...}, \"TASK_2\":{...}, \"TASK_3\":{...} } Each of the tasks contains different fields, depending on what the process is. Define data \u00b6 In case no model needs to be calculated , the data can be specified directly in the task: { \"TASK_1\":{ \"data\":{ \"datasets\": { \"TEST_1\": [\"DEVICE_11\",\"DEVICE_12\"], \"TEST_2\": [\"DEVICE_21\", \"DEVICE_22\", \"DEVICE_23\"], ... }, \"data_options\": {\"avoid_processed\": true, \"frequency\": \"1Min\", \"clean_na\": true, \"use_cache\": true, \"clean_na_method\": \"drop\", \"min_date\": null, \"max_date\": null, \"export_data\": null, \"rename_export_data\": false} } } If a model is to be calculated, the data is defined within the model key as seen below.

In json , we specify the python None as null . Want to save time? Enable use_cache and we will save some time by checking if the data we have downloaded previously from the API can be used. This also applies for pre-processing functions. Model \u00b6 Recommended to just get in touch This can be overwhelming at first.

No. 4.29e+05 ============================================================================== Warnings: [1] Standard Errors assume that the covariance matrix of the errors is correctly specified. [2] The condition number is large, 4.29e+05. This might indicate that there are strong multicollinearity or other numerical problems. This output brings a lot of information. First, we find what the dependent variable is, in our case always 'REF' . The type of model used and some general information is shown below that. More statistically important information is found in the rest of the output. Some key data: R-squared and adjusted R-squared : this is our classic correlation coefficient or R 2 . The adjusted one aims to correct the model overfitting by the inclusion of too many variables, and for that introduces a penalty on the number of variables included Below, we can find a summary of the model coefficients applied to all the variables and the P>|t| term, which indicates the significance of the term introduced in the model Model quality diagnostics are also indicated. Kurtosis and skewness are metrics for determining the distribution of the residuals. They indicate how the residuals of the model resemble a normal distribution. Below, we will review more on diagnosis plots. The Jarque Bera test indicates if the residuals are normally distributed (the null hypothesis is a joint hypothesis of the skewness being zero and the excess kurtosis being zero), and a value of zero indicates that the data is normally distributed. If the Jarque Bera test is valid (in the case above it isn't), the Durbin Watson is applicable in order to check for autocorrelation of the residuals (meaning that the residuals of our model are related among themselves and that we haven't captured some characteristics of our data with the tested model). Finally, there is a warning at the bottom indicating that the condition number is large. It suggests we might have multicollinearity problems in our model, which means that some of the independent variables might be correlated among themselves and that they are probably not necessary. Our function also depicts the results in a graphical way for us to see the model itself. It will show the training and test datasets (as Reference Train and Reference Test respectively), and the prediction results. The mean and absolute confidence intervals for 95% confidence are also shown: Now we can look at some other model quality plots. If we run the cell below, we will obtain an adaptation of the summary plots from R : from linear_regression_utils import modelRplots %matplotlib inline modelRplots(model, dataTrain, dataTest) Let's review the output step by step: Residual vs Fitted and Scale Location plot : these plots represents the model heteroscedasticity , which is a representation of the residuals versus the fitted values. This plot is helpful to check if the errors are distributed homogeneously and that we are not penalising high, low, or other values. There is also a red line which represents the average trend of this distribution which, we want it to be horizontal. For more information visit here and here . Clearly, in this model we are missing something: Normal QQ : the qq-plot is a representation of the kurtosis and skewness of the residuals distribution. If the data were well described by a normal distribution, the values should be about the same, i.e.: on the diagonal (red line). For example, in our case the model presents a deviation on both tails, indicating skewness. In general, a simple rubric to interpret a qq-plot is that if a given tail twists off counterclockwise from the reference line, there is more data in that tail of your distribution than in a theoretical normal, and if a tail twists off clockwise there is less data in that tail of your distribution than in a theoretical normal. In other words: if both tails twist counterclockwise we have heavy tails (leptokurtosis), if both tails twist clockwise, we have light tails (platykurtosis), if the right tail twists counterclockwise and the left tail twists clockwise, we have right skew if the left tail twists counterclockwise and the right tail twists clockwise, we have left skew Residuals vs Leverage : this plot is probably the most complex of them all. It shows how much leverage one single point has on the whole regression. It can be interpreted as how the average line that passes through all the data (that we are calculating with the OLS) can be modified by 'far' points in the distribution, for example, outliers. This leverage can be seen as how much a single point is able to pull down or up the average line. One way to think about whether or not the results are driven by a given data point is to calculate how far the predicted values for your data would move if your model were fit without the data point in question. This calculated total distance is called Cook's distance. We can have four cases (more information from source, here ) everything is fine (the best) high-leverage, but low-standardized residual point low-leverage, but high-standardized residual point high-leverage, high-standardized residual point (the worst) In this case, we see that our model has some points with higher leverage but low residuals (probably not too bad) and that the higher residuals are found with low leverage, which means that our model is safe to outliers. If we run this function without the filtering, some outliers will be present and the plot turns into: Finally, we can export our model and generate some metrics to evaluate the results. Machine learning example \u00b6 Machine learning algorithms promise a better representation of the sensor's data, being able to learn robust non-linear models and sequential dependencies. For that reason, we have implemented toolset based on keras with Tensorflow backend, in order to train sequential models 3 . model_description_rf = {\"model_name\": \"RF_UCD\", \"model_type\": \"RF\", \"model_target\": \"ALPHASENSE\", \"data\": {\"train\": {\"2019-03_EXT_UCD_URBAN_BACKGROUND_API\": {\"devices\": [\"5262\"], \"reference_device\": \"CITY_COUNCIL\"}}, \"test\": {\"2019-03_EXT_UCD_URBAN_BACKGROUND_API\": {\"devices\": [\"5565\"], \"reference_device\": \"CITY_COUNCIL\"}}, \"features\": {\"REF\": \"NO2_CONV\", \"A\": \"GB_2W\", \"B\": \"GB_2A\", \"C\": \"HUM\"}, \"data_options\": {\"target_raster\": '1Min', \"clean_na\": True, \"clean_na_method\": \"drop\", \"min_date\": None, \"frequency\": \"1Min\", \"max_date\": '2019-01-15'}, }, \"hyperparameters\": {\"ratio_train\": 0.75, \"min_samples_leaf\": 2, \"max_features\": None, \"n_estimators\": 100, \"shuffle_split\": True}, \"model_options\": {\"session_active_model\": True, \"show_plots\": True, \"export_model\": False, \"export_model_file\": False, \"extract_metrics\": True} } Output: Using TensorFlow backend. ...

Let's then evaluate and compare our models. In order to evaluate it's metrics, we will be using the following principles 1 2 : Info In all of the expressions below, the letter m indicates the model field, r indicates the reference field. Overbar is average and \\sigma \\sigma is the standard deviation. Linear correlation Coefficient A measure of the agreement between two signals: R = {{1 \\over N} \\sum_{i=0}^n (m_n-\\overline m)( r_n-\\overline r ) \\over \\sigma_m\\sigma_r} R = {{1 \\over N} \\sum_{i=0}^n (m_n-\\overline m)( r_n-\\overline r ) \\over \\sigma_m\\sigma_r} The correlation coefficient is bounded by the range -1 \\le R \\le 1 -1 \\le R \\le 1 . However, it is difficult to discern information about the differences in amplitude between two signals from R alone. Normalized standard deviation A measure of the differences in amplitude between two signals: $$ \\sigma * = {\\sigma_m \\over \\sigma_r} $$ unbiased Root-Mean-Square Difference A measure of how close the modelled points fall to teach other: RMSD' = \\Bigl( {1 \\over N} \\sum_{n=1}^N [(m_n - \\overline m)-(r_n - \\overline r)]^2 \\Bigr)^{0.5} RMSD' = \\Bigl( {1 \\over N} \\sum_{n=1}^N [(m_n - \\overline m)-(r_n - \\overline r)]^2 \\Bigr)^{0.5} Potential Bias Difference between the means of two fields: $$ B = \\overline m - \\overline r $$ Total RMSD A measure of the average magnitude of difference: $$ RMSD = \\Bigl( {1 \\over N} \\sum_{n=1}^N (m_n - r_n)^2 \\Bigr)^{0.5} $$ In other words, the unbiased RMSD (RMSD') is equal to the total RMSD if there is no bias between the model and the reference fields (i.e. B = 0). The relationship between both reads: RMSD^2 = B^2 + RMSD'^2 RMSD^2 = B^2 + RMSD'^2 In contrast, the unbiased RMSD may be conceptualized as an overall measure of the agreement between the aplitude ( \\sigma \\sigma ) and phase ( \\phi \\phi ) of two temporal patterns. For this reason, the correlation coefficient ( R R ), normalised standard deviation ( \\sigma* \\sigma* ), and unbiased RMSD are all referred to as patern statistics , related to one another by: RMSD'^2 = \\sigma_r^2 + \\sigma_m^2 - 2\\sigma_r\\sigma_mR RMSD'^2 = \\sigma_r^2 + \\sigma_m^2 - 2\\sigma_r\\sigma_mR Normalized and unbiased RMSD If we recast in standard deviation normalized units (indicated by the asterisk) it becomes: RMSD'^* = \\sqrt { 1 + \\sigma*^2 - 2\\sigma*R} RMSD'^* = \\sqrt { 1 + \\sigma*^2 - 2\\sigma*R} NB : the minimum of this function occurrs when \\sigma* = R \\sigma* = R . Normalized bias Gives information about the mean difference but normalized by the \\sigma* \\sigma* $$ B* = {\\overline m - \\overline r \\over \\sigma_r} $$ Target diagrams The target diagram is a plot that provides summary information about the pattern statistics as well as the bias thus yielding an overview of their respective contributions to the total RMSD. In a simple Cartesian coordinate system, the unbiased RMSD may serve as the X-axis and the bias may serve as the Y-axis. The distance between the origin and the model versus observation statistics (any point, s, within the X,Y Cartesian space) is then equal to the total RMSD. If all is normalized by the \\sigma_r \\sigma_r , the distance from the origin is again the standard deviation normalized total RMSD : 1 RMSD^{*2} = B^{*2}+RMSD^{*'2} RMSD^{*2} = B^{*2}+RMSD^{*'2} The resulting target diagram then provides information about: whether the \\sigma_m \\sigma_m is larger or smaller thann the \\sigma_r \\sigma_r whether there is a positive or negative bias Image Source: Jolliff et al. 1 Any point greater than RMSD*=1 is to be considered a poor performer since it doesn't offer improvement over the time series average. Interestingly, the target diagram has no information about the correlation coefficient R, but some can be inferred, knowing that all the points within the RMSD* <1 are positively correlated (R>0), although, in 1 it is shown that a circle marker with radius M_{R1} M_{R1} , means that all the points between that marker and the origin have a R coefficient larger than R1, where: M_{R1} = min(RMSD*') = \\sqrt {1+R1^2-2R1^2} M_{R1} = min(RMSD*') = \\sqrt {1+R1^2-2R1^2} Results \u00b6 Let's now compare both models with the target diagram: from src.visualization.visualization import targetDiagram %matplotlib inline models = dict() group = 0 for model in [ols_model, rf_model]: for dataset in ['train', 'validation']: if dataset in model.metrics.keys(): models[model.name + '_' + dataset] = model.metrics[dataset] models[model.name + '_' + dataset]['group'] = group targetDiagram(models, True, 'seaborn-talk') Output: Here, every point that falls inside the yellow circle, will have an R 2 over 0.7, and so will be the red and green for R 2 over 0.5 and 0.9 respectively. We see that only one of our models performs well in that sense, which is the training dataset of the OLS. However, this dataset performs pretty badly in the test dataset, being the LSTM options much better. This target diagram offers information about how the hyperparameters affect our networks. For instance, increasing the training epochs from 100 to 200 does not affect greatly on model performance, but the effect of filtering the data beforehand to reduce the noise shows a much better model performance in both, training and test dataframe. Export the models \u00b6 Let's now assume that we are happy with our models.

No. 4.29e+05 ============================================================================== Warnings: [1] Standard Errors assume that the covariance matrix of the errors is correctly specified. [2] The condition number is large, 4.29e+05. This might indicate that there are strong multicollinearity or other numerical problems. This output brings a lot of information. First, we find what the dependent variable is, in our case always 'REF' . The type of model used and some general information is shown below that. More statistically important information is found in the rest of the output. Some key data: R-squared and adjusted R-squared : this is our classic correlation coefficient or R 2 . The adjusted one aims to correct the model overfitting by the inclusion of too many variables, and for that introduces a penalty on the number of variables included Below, we can find a summary of the model coefficients applied to all the variables and the P>|t| term, which indicates the significance of the term introduced in the model Model quality diagnostics are also indicated. Kurtosis and skewness are metrics for determining the distribution of the residuals. They indicate how the residuals of the model resemble a normal distribution. Below, we will review more on diagnosis plots. The Jarque Bera test indicates if the residuals are normally distributed (the null hypothesis is a joint hypothesis of the skewness being zero and the excess kurtosis being zero), and a value of zero indicates that the data is normally distributed. If the Jarque Bera test is valid (in the case above it isn't), the Durbin Watson is applicable in order to check for autocorrelation of the residuals (meaning that the residuals of our model are related among themselves and that we haven't captured some characteristics of our data with the tested model). Finally, there is a warning at the bottom indicating that the condition number is large. It suggests we might have multicollinearity problems in our model, which means that some of the independent variables might be correlated among themselves and that they are probably not necessary. Our function also depicts the results in a graphical way for us to see the model itself. It will show the training and test datasets (as Reference Train and Reference Test respectively), and the prediction results. The mean and absolute confidence intervals for 95% confidence are also shown: Now we can look at some other model quality plots. If we run the cell below, we will obtain an adaptation of the summary plots from R : from linear_regression_utils import modelRplots %matplotlib inline modelRplots(model, dataTrain, dataTest) Let's review the output step by step: Residual vs Fitted and Scale Location plot : these plots represents the model heteroscedasticity , which is a representation of the residuals versus the fitted values. This plot is helpful to check if the errors are distributed homogeneously and that we are not penalising high, low, or other values. There is also a red line which represents the average trend of this distribution which, we want it to be horizontal. For more information visit here and here . Clearly, in this model we are missing something: Normal QQ : the qq-plot is a representation of the kurtosis and skewness of the residuals distribution. If the data were well described by a normal distribution, the values should be about the same, i.e.: on the diagonal (red line). For example, in our case the model presents a deviation on both tails, indicating skewness. In general, a simple rubric to interpret a qq-plot is that if a given tail twists off counterclockwise from the reference line, there is more data in that tail of your distribution than in a theoretical normal, and if a tail twists off clockwise there is less data in that tail of your distribution than in a theoretical normal. In other words: if both tails twist counterclockwise we have heavy tails (leptokurtosis), if both tails twist clockwise, we have light tails (platykurtosis), if the right tail twists counterclockwise and the left tail twists clockwise, we have right skew if the left tail twists counterclockwise and the right tail twists clockwise, we have left skew Residuals vs Leverage : this plot is probably the most complex of them all. It shows how much leverage one single point has on the whole regression. It can be interpreted as how the average line that passes through all the data (that we are calculating with the OLS) can be modified by 'far' points in the distribution, for example, outliers. This leverage can be seen as how much a single point is able to pull down or up the average line. One way to think about whether or not the results are driven by a given data point is to calculate how far the predicted values for your data would move if your model were fit without the data point in question. This calculated total distance is called Cook's distance. We can have four cases (more information from source, here ) everything is fine (the best) high-leverage, but low-standardized residual point low-leverage, but high-standardized residual point high-leverage, high-standardized residual point (the worst) In this case, we see that our model has some points with higher leverage but low residuals (probably not too bad) and that the higher residuals are found with low leverage, which means that our model is safe to outliers. If we run this function without the filtering, some outliers will be present and the plot turns into: Finally, we can export our model and generate some metrics to evaluate the results.","title":"Ordinary Least Squares example"},{"location":"Guides/data/Creating%20Models%20for%20Sensors%20Calibration/#machine-learning-example","text":"Machine learning algorithms promise a better representation of the sensor's data, being able to learn robust non-linear models and sequential dependencies.

Let's then evaluate and compare our models. In order to evaluate it's metrics, we will be using the following principles 1 2 : Info In all of the expressions below, the letter m indicates the model field, r indicates the reference field. Overbar is average and \\sigma \\sigma is the standard deviation. Linear correlation Coefficient A measure of the agreement between two signals: R = {{1 \\over N} \\sum_{i=0}^n (m_n-\\overline m)( r_n-\\overline r ) \\over \\sigma_m\\sigma_r} R = {{1 \\over N} \\sum_{i=0}^n (m_n-\\overline m)( r_n-\\overline r ) \\over \\sigma_m\\sigma_r} The correlation coefficient is bounded by the range -1 \\le R \\le 1 -1 \\le R \\le 1 . However, it is difficult to discern information about the differences in amplitude between two signals from R alone. Normalized standard deviation A measure of the differences in amplitude between two signals: $$ \\sigma * = {\\sigma_m \\over \\sigma_r} $$ unbiased Root-Mean-Square Difference A measure of how close the modelled points fall to teach other: RMSD' = \\Bigl( {1 \\over N} \\sum_{n=1}^N [(m_n - \\overline m)-(r_n - \\overline r)]^2 \\Bigr)^{0.5} RMSD' = \\Bigl( {1 \\over N} \\sum_{n=1}^N [(m_n - \\overline m)-(r_n - \\overline r)]^2 \\Bigr)^{0.5} Potential Bias Difference between the means of two fields: $$ B = \\overline m - \\overline r $$ Total RMSD A measure of the average magnitude of difference: $$ RMSD = \\Bigl( {1 \\over N} \\sum_{n=1}^N (m_n - r_n)^2 \\Bigr)^{0.5} $$ In other words, the unbiased RMSD (RMSD') is equal to the total RMSD if there is no bias between the model and the reference fields (i.e. B = 0). The relationship between both reads: RMSD^2 = B^2 + RMSD'^2 RMSD^2 = B^2 + RMSD'^2 In contrast, the unbiased RMSD may be conceptualized as an overall measure of the agreement between the aplitude ( \\sigma \\sigma ) and phase ( \\phi \\phi ) of two temporal patterns. For this reason, the correlation coefficient ( R R ), normalised standard deviation ( \\sigma* \\sigma* ), and unbiased RMSD are all referred to as patern statistics , related to one another by: RMSD'^2 = \\sigma_r^2 + \\sigma_m^2 - 2\\sigma_r\\sigma_mR RMSD'^2 = \\sigma_r^2 + \\sigma_m^2 - 2\\sigma_r\\sigma_mR Normalized and unbiased RMSD If we recast in standard deviation normalized units (indicated by the asterisk) it becomes: RMSD'^* = \\sqrt { 1 + \\sigma*^2 - 2\\sigma*R} RMSD'^* = \\sqrt { 1 + \\sigma*^2 - 2\\sigma*R} NB : the minimum of this function occurrs when \\sigma* = R \\sigma* = R . Normalized bias Gives information about the mean difference but normalized by the \\sigma* \\sigma* $$ B* = {\\overline m - \\overline r \\over \\sigma_r} $$ Target diagrams The target diagram is a plot that provides summary information about the pattern statistics as well as the bias thus yielding an overview of their respective contributions to the total RMSD. In a simple Cartesian coordinate system, the unbiased RMSD may serve as the X-axis and the bias may serve as the Y-axis. The distance between the origin and the model versus observation statistics (any point, s, within the X,Y Cartesian space) is then equal to the total RMSD. If all is normalized by the \\sigma_r \\sigma_r , the distance from the origin is again the standard deviation normalized total RMSD : 1 RMSD^{*2} = B^{*2}+RMSD^{*'2} RMSD^{*2} = B^{*2}+RMSD^{*'2} The resulting target diagram then provides information about: whether the \\sigma_m \\sigma_m is larger or smaller thann the \\sigma_r \\sigma_r whether there is a positive or negative bias Image Source: Jolliff et al. 1 Any point greater than RMSD*=1 is to be considered a poor performer since it doesn't offer improvement over the time series average.

A test is a collection of devices (SCKs or not), that have a common purpose. They can be located in the same spot (co-location) or not, and the main idea is that we centralise the data in a common instance for easy analysis. Tests have dates, authors, can have comments (for us to remember what we did), a report attached and can be in different conditions (outdoor, indoor)... We will put all this metadata in a yaml file to help use look for the tests later on. Tests can also have different sources. They could be csv files, xls files or data from the Smart Citizen API. For the local files, we will first pre-process them with the scripts in the data/scripts folder and then place them in the data/raw folder, in csv format.

This page includes all necessary information to get started with the sensor kit. In addition, further information and graphic material is available in the Annexes of this manual. WIP Some items in this user manual are a work-in-progress . You will find a banner in the sections with a WIP marker and a summary of all Known issues which will be fixed in future firmware versions. Hardware \u00b6 Pack \u00b6 The delivered sensor pack is comprised of these components: Smart Citizen Kit (SCK) GPS and antenna USB charger and cable Customized enclosure The SCK and GPS are assembled with a 3D-printed Clip: The enclosure is made out of a modified saddle bag. Find more details in enclosure : Licenses All the software used in this (product/prototype/design), unless otherwise stated, is released under GNU GPL v3.0. Likewise, the hardware design files for the Smart Citizen Kit are released under CERN OHL v1.2. Please refer to the corresponding license for details regarding permissions, limitations, and conditions of use. This paragraph only applies to this section and the enclosure customization, and not to the rest of components such as the GPS or antenna. Sensors \u00b6 The sensors are based on the Smart Citizen Kit, with the following components. Measurements Measurement Units Sensor Air temperature \u00baC Sensirion SHT-31 Relative Humidity % REL Sensirion SHT-31 Noise level dBA Invensense ICS-434342 Ambient light Lux Rohm BH1721FVC Barometric pressure Pa NXP MPL3115A26 Equivalent Carbon Dioxide ppm AMS CCS811 Volatile Organic Compounds ppb AMS CCS811 Particulate Matter PM 1 / 2.5 / 10 \u00b5g/m3 Planttower PMS 5003 GPS \u00b6 The selected NEO-M8U GPS Breakout from Sparkfun is a high quality GPS board. The NEO-M8U takes advantage of u-blox's Untethered Dead Reckoning (UDR) technology. The NEO-M8U module is a 72-channel u-blox M8 engine GNSS receiver, meaning it can receive signals from the GPS, GLONASS, Galileo, and BeiDou constellations with ~2.5 meter accuracy . The module supports concurrent reception of three GNSS systems. The combination of GNSS and integrated 3D sensor measurements on the NEO-M8U provide accurate, real-time positioning rates of up to 30Hz. Compared to other GPS modules, this breakout maximizes position accuracy in dense cities or covered areas. Even under poor signal conditions, continuous positioning is provided in urban environments and is also available during complete signal loss (e.g. short tunnels and parking garages). Lock time is further reduced with on-board rechargeable battery; there is a backup power enabling the GPS to get a hot lock within seconds. The SparkFun NEO-M8U GPS Breakout 1 is also equipped with an on-board rechargeable battery that provides power to the RTC on the NEO-M8U. This reduces the time-to-first fix from a cold start (~26s) to a hot start (~1.5s). The battery will maintain RTC and GNSS orbit data without being connected to power for plenty of time. The GPS uses a ceramic patch antenna 2 with the following features: The U.FL antenna connector does not need to be unplugged from the board, specially never when the board is being powered in order to avoid damaging the circuitry: GPS and Antenna images by Sparkfun (License CC BY 2.0 ) and edited by Smart Citizen. Enclosure \u00b6 The enclosure is made out of a modified generic Saddle Bag from Vaude - (Vaude Race Light L). Enclosure images by Vaude The enclosure was specifically chosen because: It is a widely available enclosure by a well stablished bike equipment manufacturer Size and materials Low weight and flexible outter fitting for low vibrations and transmissibility The sensors are internally suspended by a polypropilene folding and the air intakes are made out of PLA in a 3D printer. Measurement principle The sensors are enclosed in the saddle bag in order to avoid dirt and water spills. The measurement method in the enclosure ensures there is: 1. sufficient air flow parallel to the sensor's surface, 2. a limited gas speed across the sensors and minimum gas residence time to ensure sensitivity. The placement of the sensors was tested and compared with different options. Results are shown in the Test section . The images below show the measurement principle and a functional diagram for the sensor\u2019s enclosure. Please, ensure both intakes and exhaust are not covered and that air can flow freely between both. Power management \u00b6 WIP This will be improved with new Firmware Features. Current battery duration is 1 day with 2-3 short bicycle trips of 30' each. This will improve with upcoming firmware updates. The SCK comes with a 2000mAh LiPo battery to provide autonomy while measuring in the city. The battery is meant to be a complete power option for short-term measurements (approximatively 1-2 days). The battery duration is dependent on which sensors are enabled or disabled, and the amount of time the dynamic measurement interval is active. You will note that the kit turns itself off while operating on battery. Actually, this is what we call sleep-mode , an operation mode implemented to reduce consumption while on battery operation. Battery charging \u00b6 The SCK has a micro USB port and can be charged like any Smartphone or Tablet using a dedicated adapter or a computer USB port. A cable is provided and does not need to be disconnected from the device. The cable can be stored in the saddle\u2019s bag back compartment. User feedback \u00b6 The LED serves as an indication of the battery status. If the LED is flashing orange it indicates that the battery must be charged. The battery takes about 4 hours to fully charge. When the battery is fully charged, the LED will change from orange to green . Remember that in addition to these colors you will have the state color of the kit: configuration, network and sd. More details Find more details about power management under the data board section of the documentation Data Acquisition \u00b6 Data can be recorded offline or published online to the Smart Citizen Platform. The SCK owner needs to configure how the data is going to be stored in the Setup process, either in the SD card or via network connectivity (WiFi) to the platform. When the SCK is configured in sdcard mode , it will store the data at the requested interval* in the SD card. In the case of network connectivity, in normal conditions, the device will send data over to the Smart Citizen Platform via WiFi (WPA2 Personal or WEP). Additionally, when configured to send data over WiFi, if there is a SD card present, it will also store the data in it as a backup. Finally, in the special case of mobile sensors, where network connectivity is not always present, the data can be recorded offline on its internal dedicated flash memory of 8MB and later publish this over WiFi connectivity. Data is published using MQTT messages to the Smart Citizen Platform. NTP is used for syncing the built-in RTC. Recording interval \u00b6 In order to understand the reading and publication intervals, it is important to describe how the structure of the measurements is done: Overall reading interval : base period for the SCK to take a measurement Individual sensor reading interval : period for each sensor to take a measurement. It is defined as N times the Overall reading interval Publication interval : time for the SCK to publish to the Smart Citizen Platform, independent of the reading interval. Each of the sensors can be configured independently, with a reading interval N times the overall reading interval . For the Almabike project, all the sensors are read every 60s if the sensors are static. When a GPS movement is detected, the reading interval goes down to 5s. In the case of the Almabike project , the sensors store data internally in the Flash memory during the bicycle trips and publish it in batch when the configured WiFi network is visible. Data is also stored in the SD card for later use in CSV file format. User interfaces \u00b6 The data board features a set of user interfaces which provide feedback to the user, as well as two buttons with different functionalities. The main RGB LED provides general feedback of the data board status. Additionally, two buttons are provided for user action. A hardware reset button, which forces a power cut to the board, and a power button, used to change the device's mode, turn on and off the device, and to perform a factory reset. You can see both buttons below: The button \u00b6 The main button interaction is detailed below: Function Button action ON Push the button OFF Push the button for 5 seconds CHANGE MODE Push the button multiple times to choose: Setup Wi-Fi Pink FACTORY RESET Push the button 15 seconds for a full reset Troubleshooting Have a look at the troubleshoothing for more information.

After the configuration process, data will be available on the SmartCitizen platform. You can explore the data there or download it using the CSV Download option (guide here ) Make sure data is recorded For the Almabike project , it is important to follow the steps below in order to select the correct kit blueprint while registering the sensor: Click the \ud83d\udee0\ufe0f icon in the bottom right corner Choose the blueprint of the device you want to setup, in this case: #32 SCK 2.1 GPS Click save and continue the process as usually Due to privacy concerns, all geolocated data for the Almabike project will remain private unless the user choses to release it.

This will allow to visit any of your devices and select the option \"Make private\" under the \"Open Data\" settings: Before going on a trip \u00b6 Before starting to pedal, make sure that this checklist is all fine: The kit is either in SD card or network mode The kit has enough battery (check the status of the LED ) The GPS is being powered. The GPS might take some time to retrieve a valid location. This can be assessed by checking that the GPS Blue LED is blinking . If you want to make sure the complete trip is recorded, make sure the GPS can receive a clear view of the sky The kit is well placed inside the enclosure and the cable does not obstruct the exhaust What is the GPS fix? The GPS fix is the term used for describing whether or not the GPS has successfully received a valid location Known issues \u00b6 Below, there is a list of known issues with the 0.9.8 version of the Firmware. These will be fixed soon. Currently, the SCK does not report errors permanently and only during 10s. This is shown as a fast led blinking ( ). Under certain conditions, the dynamic interval is not instantly recovered after a quick stop, and it might take 1' to restart Under certain sky visibility conditions, the GPS does not report a valid fix. It is normally fixed with a clear sky view. For this, follow the instructions in Before going on a trip Updating the firmware Once there is a firmware release with these updates, refer to this guide for instructions on how to update it in your kit Additional graphic material \u00b6 Test results \u00b6 The purpose of these tests is to assess the best solution for measuring particulate matter and environmental conditions with two different enclosures and hence exposure methods. The tests performed are: Indoor particulate tests Outdoor dynamic vs. static comparison Outdoor dynamic comparison Indoor particulate tests \u00b6 These tests were conducted indoor using a Marlin Smoke Machine in order to assess the difference between each enclosure. Free air comparison An initial comparison between both sensors in open air is done in order to assess the difference between each sensor measuring in open air with smoke injection up to 4000ug/m3. In the figure, two distinct phases need to be highlighted: In the figure, two distinct phases need to be highlighted: injection (when there is smoke being injected in the room), and dispersion, when the injected smoke is being dispersed with a fan. Both sensors correlate well in the injection phase and dispersion phases, but they do have an offset in the dispersion phase that is not identified, and that could be simply due to the sensor's position, although they are less than 10cm apart. This maximum offset is 700-1000ug/m3 in an evironment of very large particle concentration numbers 3000ug/m3. Temperature and humidity offsets in this case are found to be less than 0.5degC in temperature and negligible for relative humidity. Enclosure comparisons The purpose of this comparison is to determine which measurement principle of the following is the best: Directly exposing the sensors to the air flow by the bicycle's movement Expose them inside a \"chamber\" in which air flow is contained and briefly slowed down The following graph shows the comparison of both enclosures mounted on the bike, and a rider on the bike. The comparison shows that the direct sensor exposure (ORTLIEB in the graph) is not as sensitive to particulate in the air as the chamber exposure is (VAUDE in the graph). This offset is not justified by the offset seen in dispersion phase in the free air test as it is also reduced in the injection phase. On the other hand, the chamber exposure shows a longer tail in the dispersion phase, as the particles can remain in the chamber and not be fully evacuated, although reactivity to larger quantities remains as seen in the graph below. It also shows that the VAUDE enclosure evacuates better heat generated by the electronics, as the temperature offset between both enclosures is reduced. As seen in the following tests, the offset of each enclosure with respect to real temperature is between 1 to 3degC and it could be compensated by software a posteriori , but it can't be avoided as the sensors are confined in the enclosure. This factor is not critical for the exposure assessment and decision, as the material of the enclosure differ, and it's less traspirant in the ORTLIEB option. Chamber vs. Reference test The comparison of the best-so-far enclosure is shown below, with respect to the reference sensor in free air. This comparison shows how the enclosure effectively slows down the air flow charged with particles, and still correlates properly with the free air sensor in the injection phase, although not in the dispersion phase. This indicates that the accumulation and evacuation process of the particles within the chamber is not fully controlled in this enclosure. Nevertheless, the levels of particles in this setup are not comparable to any actual particulate levels found in actual urban environments. The offset in temperature and humidity is of approximatively 3degC at the end of the test, and follows a normal heat up curve with logarithmic trend, equally for humidity with 7%rh. Direct exposure vs. Reference test The direct exposure vs reference comparison shows an inferior sensitivity, already seen in the enclosure comparison, of the direct exposure option versus the actual concentration. The measurements also show less reactivity in some instances, smoothing out some peaks in particle concentrations. Temperature trace shows an offset of 3degC at the end of the test, similarly to that of the other enclosure, with an humidity difference of 4-5%rh. Outdoor tests \u00b6 These tests are aimed at comparing outdoor measurements with sensor trips. These measurements use the same sensor as the ones mounted on the bicycle. A script is used to post-process the data based on location and derive a comparison between both measurements. Comparison bike front vs. bike back This comparison shows the difference between the different metrics when measuring gas using the same enclosure in the front (black) and in the back (green): After a short stabilisation period, this test shows that PM2.5 measurements are equally correlated between both positions. In the case of the temperature sensor, a difference of up to 2\u00baC was seen (higher in the saddle\u2019s position), with better sensitivity in the case of the front-sensor, due to a lower confinement and larger surface area: Due to project guidelines, the saddle position of the sensor is considered sufficient for the purpose of monitoring air quality. However, it\u2019s worth mentioning that this sensor location requires attention for the sensors to never be covered by the rider\u2019s clothing. Furthermore, the front position shows a better response for the sensor temperature representativity and sensitivity as seen above, with a potential better GPS fix quality. This latter issue is compensated with the usage of an active patch antenna with higher gain. Further tests are currently being conducted in order to assess the performance of the sensors when compared to static ones.

The NEO-M8U takes advantage of u-blox's Untethered Dead Reckoning (UDR) technology. The NEO-M8U module is a 72-channel u-blox M8 engine GNSS receiver, meaning it can receive signals from the GPS, GLONASS, Galileo, and BeiDou constellations with ~2.5 meter accuracy . The module supports concurrent reception of three GNSS systems. The combination of GNSS and integrated 3D sensor measurements on the NEO-M8U provide accurate, real-time positioning rates of up to 30Hz. Compared to other GPS modules, this breakout maximizes position accuracy in dense cities or covered areas. Even under poor signal conditions, continuous positioning is provided in urban environments and is also available during complete signal loss (e.g. short tunnels and parking garages). Lock time is further reduced with on-board rechargeable battery; there is a backup power enabling the GPS to get a hot lock within seconds. The SparkFun NEO-M8U GPS Breakout 1 is also equipped with an on-board rechargeable battery that provides power to the RTC on the NEO-M8U. This reduces the time-to-first fix from a cold start (~26s) to a hot start (~1.5s). The battery will maintain RTC and GNSS orbit data without being connected to power for plenty of time.

As seen in the following tests, the offset of each enclosure with respect to real temperature is between 1 to 3degC and it could be compensated by software a posteriori , but it can't be avoided as the sensors are confined in the enclosure. This factor is not critical for the exposure assessment and decision, as the material of the enclosure differ, and it's less traspirant in the ORTLIEB option. Chamber vs. Reference test The comparison of the best-so-far enclosure is shown below, with respect to the reference sensor in free air. This comparison shows how the enclosure effectively slows down the air flow charged with particles, and still correlates properly with the free air sensor in the injection phase, although not in the dispersion phase. This indicates that the accumulation and evacuation process of the particles within the chamber is not fully controlled in this enclosure. Nevertheless, the levels of particles in this setup are not comparable to any actual particulate levels found in actual urban environments. The offset in temperature and humidity is of approximatively 3degC at the end of the test, and follows a normal heat up curve with logarithmic trend, equally for humidity with 7%rh. Direct exposure vs. Reference test The direct exposure vs reference comparison shows an inferior sensitivity, already seen in the enclosure comparison, of the direct exposure option versus the actual concentration. The measurements also show less reactivity in some instances, smoothing out some peaks in particle concentrations. Temperature trace shows an offset of 3degC at the end of the test, similarly to that of the other enclosure, with an humidity difference of 4-5%rh.","title":"Indoor particulate tests"},{"location":"Guides/deployments/Almabike%20sensors/#outdoor-tests","text":"These tests are aimed at comparing outdoor measurements with sensor trips. These measurements use the same sensor as the ones mounted on the bicycle. A script is used to post-process the data based on location and derive a comparison between both measurements. Comparison bike front vs. bike back This comparison shows the difference between the different metrics when measuring gas using the same enclosure in the front (black) and in the back (green): After a short stabilisation period, this test shows that PM2.5 measurements are equally correlated between both positions. In the case of the temperature sensor, a difference of up to 2\u00baC was seen (higher in the saddle\u2019s position), with better sensitivity in the case of the front-sensor, due to a lower confinement and larger surface area: Due to project guidelines, the saddle position of the sensor is considered sufficient for the purpose of monitoring air quality. However, it\u2019s worth mentioning that this sensor location requires attention for the sensors to never be covered by the rider\u2019s clothing. Furthermore, the front position shows a better response for the sensor temperature representativity and sensitivity as seen above, with a potential better GPS fix quality. This latter issue is compensated with the usage of an active patch antenna with higher gain. Further tests are currently being conducted in order to assess the performance of the sensors when compared to static ones.","title":"Outdoor tests"},{"location":"Guides/deployments/Almabike%20sensors/#references","text":"GPS NEO-M8U Specification: https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/6/d/7/c/6/NEO-M8U_DataSheet__UBX-15015679_.pdf \u21a9 Ceramic Patch Antenna Specification: https://www.molex.com/pdm_docs/as/2066400001-AS.pdf \u21a9","title":"References"},{"location":"Guides/deployments/Deploying%20SCK/","text":"Deploying the Smart Citizen Kit \u00b6 The Smart Citizen Kit can be used in both, indoor or outdoor setups.

Hardware \u00b6 The unit should come assembled and ready to use. It consists of various parts: Enclosure and mounting system Sensors module Power supply Physical measurements \u00b6 The Station measurements are shown in the image below: Dimensions with cover (length, height, depth) (approx.): 340mm x 160mm x 230 mm Dimensions without cover (length, height, depth) (approx): 260mm x 120mm x 180mm Enclosure and mounting system \u00b6 The enclosure holds the sensors in place and protects them against weather. A rain and sun radiation cover for protection made out of white sandwich panel or dibond . This element carries out the structural support of the station and protects the unit against rain, wind or heat. The sensors module which contains the electronics and sensors, is attached to the cover and can be removed without having to uninstall the rain cover. Finally, The power supply , is a separated from the module, so that intervention in the sensors' area can be performed safely with a tangible desconection of the mains power. Flexible attachment This mounting is thought to work on a lampost, fence or wall. We recommend a somewhat flexible join (i.e. zip-ties) in case of windy locations Power supply details Refer to the Power supply section and the guide on it's installation for more details. Sensors module \u00b6 The sensors module is the area where all the action takes place. This is the bottom view: An this is the inside one (will change with further development): The Station is powered through it's USB input. It can be reset by either: disconnecting the power to the mains introducing a thin screw driver or pen through the RESET button hole indicated above Power USB We do not recommend to use any other cable than the supplied one in outdoor conditions. Power supply \u00b6 The Smart Citizen Station uses the Smart Citizen Power Supply for power. The input of the station is the connector shown in the image below. Inside the station, power is distributed accross the different units. Data and power goes through the input, in order to connect to the Data Board and be able to use the Shell . All voltage levels inside the station are below 5V. Using the power supply For more information about how to handle the Smart Citizen Power Supply, have a look at this guide for safety instructions. Installation \u00b6 Follow the steps below for making sure everything is working fine before setting it up in an outdoor spot. First, power the unit with the USB provided. The unit can be powered with a normal USB charger first for configuration, or with a laptop as well. If you have a laptop at hand it's going to be handy for step 3. The indicator LED should turn on. It will first be GREEN, WHITE (may take a while) and then RED or BLUE, depending on the configuration of the Station. You can see more information on the LED status here If you have a laptop available, it is recommended to check with the Shell and request the sensors: sensor After this, a list of all the enabled sensors should appear. You can configure the recording interval as well, in case you need less or more data. If all is working fine, you can now proceed to installation of the unit in an outdoor spot. This is a list of all the possible sensors in the Station (seen from the hardware side), the actual sensor list will depend on your version: Temperature Humidity Battery Light Noise dBA Barometric pressure VOC Gas CCS811 eCO2 Gas CCS811 PM board Dallas Temperature ADS1x15 ADC 0x48 Ch0 ADS1x15 ADC 0x48 Ch1 ADS1x15 ADC 0x48 Ch2 ADS1x15 ADC 0x48 Ch3 ADS1x15 ADC 0x49 Ch0 ADS1x15 ADC 0x49 Ch1 ADS1x15 ADC 0x49 Ch2 ADS1x15 ADC 0x49 Ch3 ADS1x15 ADC 0x4A Ch0 ADS1x15 ADC 0x4A Ch1 ADS1x15 ADC 0x4A Ch2 ADS1x15 ADC 0x4A Ch3 ADS1x15 ADC 0x4B Ch0 ADS1x15 ADC 0x4B Ch1 ADS1x15 ADC 0x4B Ch2 ADS1x15 ADC 0x4B Ch3 Ext PM_A 1.0 Ext PM_A 2.5 Ext PM_A 10.0 Ext PM_B 1.0 Ext PM_B 2.5 Ext PM_B 10.0 Check the meaning of the sensor channels This a complete list of sensors.

Each electrochemical sensor has two outputs read by one of the ADCs so, for 4 electrochemical sensors, we need at least 8 channels. Physical installation \u00b6 The enclosure can be installed using the mounting holes seen below. There is sufficient space to pass zip ties. If you want to use drills, we recommend at least 6mm screws (or 8mm) and to dissasemble the plastic cover from the sandwich pannel for safer installation. Below are some general guidelines for the installation of the device: Avoid areas with moist accumulation when possible Avoid temperature and humidity transients Avoid covering the sensors in front of the sensors, specially the PM sensor Avoid covering the microphone and particles to go in the microphone port Avoid direct flow towards the sensors. If exposed under flow conditions, have the flow go parallel to the sensors' surface Despite the umbrella cover, sun radiation and transients are better to be avoided A good height for installing the sensors is somewhere between 2-3m, but it all depends on the case study and available support structures. Configuration \u00b6 The process to register the Smart Citizen Station and send data to the platform is the same as the one from the Smart Citizen Kit ( start.smartcitizen.me ): Only, make sure to select the appropiate Kit ( #33 Smart Citizen Station 2.1 rev3 ) in the Advanced Selection field: Advanced tip If you are familiar with Shell commands, or you use Arduino IDE to interact with the Station, you can use this Shell Guide , and connect to the device.

For this reason, it's necessary to store the physical ID (hardware ID) of the Station alonside to the virtual device in the Smart Citizen Platform. The harwdware ID should normally be in a sticker to the enclosure both inside and outside and looks like this: SCAS2100XX This number is important to relate to the actual calibration values of the sensors, stored in the data repository . In order to postprocess the data and calculate pollutants, make sure that the Hardware ID is safely stored in the platform's device, by posting this data to postprocessing_info field of the device. You can follow these instructions to store the postprocessing_info of your device. All the data is sent in raw to the Smart Citizen Platform and it's then processed outside of the sensors themselves. Both raw, and processed data are kept on the platform and can be accessed at any time. Data can be published to other APIs or to Zenodo as well, in case of research projects that seek contribution to Open Science Datasets. More on the processing of the data Check this guide to learn more about how to postprocess the data of the sensors your own way. Troubleshooting \u00b6 The first step in case anything goes wrong, is to reset the unit by pressing the RESET button.

If not, press the button multiple times until the LED turns red. On boarding \u00b6 To start the installation simply visit the setup website stations.iscape.smartcitizen.me . Warning We will need you to send us the following information once you are done with the setup: the device ID , which appears in the URL of your device https://smartcitizen.me/kits/ XXXX and the physical station ID that corresponds to that device ID , which can be found in a sticker underneath. Get data from the SD card \u00b6 You will need to access the Kit in order to get the SD card. For this, first unscrew the two white layers at the top of the station with the keys provided in the Pack: Then turn off your Kit by pressing the button for 5 seconds and remove the micro SD card. You can plug the card on your computer using a Micro SD card reader. Warning Handle the SD card with care! It might drop inside the station You will find inside a YYYY-MM-DD.CSV with all the data. You can follow the Manual CSV data upload guide to manually upload the data to the platform. Power it back on! Once you are done uploading the data and you want to keep on logging, put the SD card back in with the Kit OFF and press the button. It will come back to life! Outdoor installation \u00b6 Use the perforated steel tape and the M6 provided to mount the Station on any street light or pole. The Pack also includes the required wrench: Also, a temperature probe needs to be extracted from the bottom of the station: And it should look like this: Umbrella cover installation \u00b6 Due to some issues with the waterproofness of the Living Lab Station, we have developed a solution to protect it from the rain. This solution is shown in the pictures below, and it's meant to solve these problems for the current version of the LLS. The newer version of the LLS has a simpler setup, already including such cover to protect it from the rain or sun radiation. Beware of collisions As you can see, the cover is a rugged piece and it's only meant for the current version of the station. Please, be careful and do not fit it in places where people could bump into it. This is what you get in the package (except the wrench): Step by step If you have the 3D printed cover on the Smart Citizen Kit, it's time to remove it. There is no need to remove the two top white layers (in the pictures we did it without them) Insert the threads in the already mounted t-slots. The distance between them is ~50mm Insert the 4x flat spacer in the threads Place the cover on the station Place the serrated spacers, with the serrated side on the outer part (they help to hold the station in place) Place the perforated steel stripe in one of the sides. Don't tight it too much, so that you have room to place it in the pole Put the station in it's final location, and tighten it with the perforated steel stripes. Play with both sides, so that the stripes are tight on the pole You are done! Power supply \u00b6 The Station can be directly powered at 220-240V AC (Max. consumption with the AC supply is 5W). It can also be powered via USB, with a normal phone charger (5V and 750mA max). However, there is a bit to do in order to change it. Let's see how! Batteries The Living Lab Station has a higher consumption, mostly due to the fans on the two PM sensors. That means the internal battery last just for 20h, and it is only aimed at providing backup power. For example, we can connect the station on the street light electric line, so the Station gets charged during the night when the lights are on. Solar Panel Unfortunately, we are having some problems with the PV Solar Panel system to power the Station independently. The system is currently under tests, and it will be available in the next few months. Changing power supplies \u00b6 Before we start, some tools that will be helpful during the process: Danger Unplug the station before starting this process from any type of external supply Step by step Remove the two covers using the allen keys as explained on the setup instructions. Remove the layer which contains the kit. The kit is attached to the layers below, as seen in the image Unplug the different connectors in the kit: I2C, battery and USB You can use nose pliers for the USB and the battery Time to get to the power layer, this time, two blue layers will come off Unscrew the cover for the power area Make sure there is no energy left in the power supply by checking that there is no LED on in it. Then, remove the cables from the power supply and the white brackets Extract the cable from the base's cable gland Cover the cable gland again and remove the square cable gland on the other side Exchange the rubber in the cable gland with the one provided with a hole Put the cable in and fix the gland in place. Leave sufficient overhead in the cable to be able to connect it to the kit Put the power cover back on Put the kit's layer back on and pass the cables through Connect everything in this order: first, the I2C connector, second, the battery, third, the USB Put the kit's layer on again. Verify that the o-ring fit's in properly. Close everything and put both layers back on on Now, you can use the USB power supply or the battery pack! Dimensions \u00b6 Troubleshooting \u00b6 The station does not respond \u00b6 If the station does not respond or does not work properly you can do two things: Reboot your Station You can fully reboot your Station by pressing the reset button located under the sensors board as seen on the picture. That will not delete any configuration, it will simply restart your device. Press the RESET button for a second. The light will go off and on and the device will start again. You can also perform a reboot by disconnecting the battery and the USB cable so that the station is restarted. In this way we will not lose any data and configuration except the time in case of being in SD mode . Factory reset your Station You can fully reset the Station to the default settings so you can register again your device. Press the main button for 15 seconds . After 5 seconds the light will go off and will go on again after 15 seconds. Then you can release the button and your device will be fully resetted as a brand new Station. The LED does not turn on and the station does not work \u00b6 First of all, push the station button. Maybe it's simply off. If this does not work, surely the station has been left without battery. You will have to charge it using the USB charger. Any other mobile charger will also work. We will know that it is charging when the LED emits orange pulses and once the battery is charged it will emit green The station does not store the data on the SD card. \u00b6 Some SD cards may have problems over time. We can try formatting it but in case it does not work any micro SD card we buy at any mobile or computer store it will work. The size is not important and any micro SD or micro SDHC 512MB card up to 32GB will work.","title":"iSCAPE Station V1"},{"location":"Guides/deployments/Deploying%20iSCAPE%20Station%20V1/#components","text":"The Station is a modular system based on different sensor board that connected to a central datalogger.

In this case, the tilt should be designed so that the panel points directly at the sun at noon. To calculate, multiply your latitude by 0.9, and add 30 degrees. The 6W 6V solar panel that we suggest using, is calculated for having enough amount of insolation during winter in Spain's latitude, considering the amount of hours/day there is sun in winter.

You can also use a rubber band, but it won't last long under the sun - clip_big_batt.stl One for smaller batteries that uses the PMS5003 cable to hold the battery (valid for default battery of 2000mAh) - clip_wo_oring.stl Cable gland There is a small cable gland (part 1 and 2 )that fits into the HDPE blue base to hold the cable in place. It's split into two, so that the USB head can go through. Foam cover An additional foam cover has been included for high humidity environments. The print settings in SliC3r need to be adapted with: 0.2mm layer height Detect thin walls CNC'ed parts \u00b6 CNC milling of 15mm HDPE sheets for the base (we make it in blue), and 10mm for the top (we make it in white). Base The base is made out of a ouble sided milling on blue HDPE. The holes are for self-tightening screws (such as these ones ). The bottom side has a channel for avoid water dripping into the sensors and break the flow. It also has small machined slots for easier disassembly: An additional cap is added to cover the hole in case no cable is needed. Top cover The top cover is a single sided milling in white HDPE. The part has a stepped milling for letting heat out, without letting water in. Sheet metal \u00b6 This plate is meant for attaching the whole system to a wall or pole, as well as supporting the installation of an external power supply in an IP65 box. The sheet is 1mm stainless steel with laser cutting and bent in two edges 90\u00ba. 3D printed Enclosure \u00b6 This enclosure is meant to be fully 3D printed in PLA in a normal desktop 3D printed machine. This design is not aiming to be the best design in the world, but one that anyone can make and modify such as our contributors . Printing settings \u00b6 We have tested the 3D printed components with both PLA or ABS. Good results are achieved with a normal 0.4mm nozzle and 0.2 layer height. No raft or brim are needed. Components \u00b6 Clip The SCK and the PMS5003 are held together by a 3D printed clip . No support is needed for this part. Base and top covers Base and cover parts . Support is not needed for these part. A gasket can be added to the joint with adhesive foam. You can increase the top's thickness if you need better isolation, or use the foam provided with the SCK's box as an insulator. Also, tin foil is quite a good reflective material and helps with sun radiation. Enlarged cover If you want to have some more space in the cover (eg to put a Solar MPPT and an additional battery in it), you can use the File COVER25.ST L. This cover gives you an additional height of 2,5cm. Locks Flexible locks are also provided for better fixation (2 units per enclosure). No support is needed. Cable gland A small cable gland is also design to help improve waterproofness and fix the USB cable. It can be stored in the pocket next to the opening. A very DIY enclosure \u00b6 Warning Keep in mind that casing is designed for short outdoor deployments. If you want a case for long exhibitions abroad, we will soon have a much more rugged enclosure ready! Also, feel free to explore all our enclosures repository for this and other versions of our hardware. Step by step First, you will need the two 3D printed clips.

By using a debugger we will be able to see what is going on inside another program while it executes or even crashes. This is fairly straight forward when you code for a modern day computer, since most IDEs have a proper interface integrated for it. However, debugging a chip like the SAMD21 can sometimes be tricky and here is where it's interesting to use a debugging kit. To keep it simple: our final target is to be able to interact with the SAMD21 (or the chip) while it's executing the program and tell it to pause the execution, give us the value of some variables and then continue. We will release a fairly extensive report with documentation on this process, but for those interested in reading an overview on how to debug, this post can be a short introduction. So, here we go! The first item we need is the Open On-Chip Debugger (OpenOCD) which provides debugging with the assistance of a debug adapter . This adapter is a small hardware module which helps provide the right kind of electrical signaling to the target being debugged. These are required since the debug host, on which OpenOCD runs (i.e. your computer, a Raspberry PI...) won\u2019t usually have native support for such signaling, or the connector needed to hook up to the target. These adapters are sometimes packaged as discrete dongles, which may generically be called hardware interface dongles (and are quite expensive). Some development boards also integrate them directly, which may let the development board connect directly to the debug host over USB (and sometimes also to power it over USB, like the Arduino Genuino Zero ). In the case of the Smart Smart Citizen Kit , we have a SWD Adapter that supports Serial Wire Debug signaling to communicate with the ARM core . In our approach, using a complete open toolchain , OpenOCD is be running on a Raspberry Pi, and communicating with the SCK's SWD through the GPIO pins of the Pi. Finally, to be able to actually see what is going on inside our firmware while it executes , we need something that is able to read and understand the machine code and hand it over to a human understandable interface. This is where GDB kicks in and helps us by: Starting our program, specifying anything that might affect its behavior. Make our program stop on specified conditions. Examine what has happened when our program has stopped. Change things in our program, so we can experiment with correcting the effects of one bug and go on to learn about another. GDB and OpenOCD will be running in a Raspberry Pi hooked up to the SWD interface of the SCK, and we will see what's going on in them from our computer's terminal via SSH. Fairly simple , right? Now, we can make some changes to our code, make GDB flash it to the SCK and keep debugging in a completely open toolchain! Debugger setup using a Raspberry Pi \u00b6 First download and copy Raspbian Lite to your SDcard, here are the installation docs . Add wifi configuration Create a file name wpa_supplicant.conf on the /boot partition of the SD card, the content of this file should looks like this: ctrl_interface=DIR=/var/run/wpa_supplicant GROUP=netdev update_config=1 network={ ssid=\"wifi_ssid\" psk=\"wifi_password\" } Replacing wifi_ssid and wifi_password with your actual wifi network information. The wpa_supplicant.conf file will be copied to /etc/wpa_supplicant/ directory automatically once the Raspberry Pi is booted up. Enable SSH server. SSH access is disabled as default for security reasons. To enable the SSH server when Raspberry Pi is booted up for the first time: create a file called ssh with no file extension and no contents, and copy it to the /boot partition on the SD card. Find your raspberry on the network In order to find a raspberry pi over the network we can use commands like these: Linux MY_IP_RANGE=$(ip addr | grep 'state UP' -A2 | tail -n1 | awk '{print $2}') && nmap -sn $MY_IP_RANGE && IP=$(arp -na | grep b8:27:eb | grep -Eo '[0-9]{1,3}\\.[0-9]{1,3}\\.[0-9]{1,3}\\.[0-9]{1,3}') && ssh $IP; Mac MY_RANGE=$(ip addr | grep \"UP\" -A3 | grep '192' -A0 | awk '{print $2}') && nmap -sn $MY_RANGE && arp -na | grep b8:27:eb SSH login without password: If you have never generated a RSA key: ssh-keygen without passphrase Copy the key to the Raspberry: ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub raspi-address Once booted, it will connect to the network. The command above ( MY_IP... ) finds it and logs into it via SSH. Once you are logged to your raspberry pi and connected to the internet, do a system upgrade : sudo apt-get install rpi-update sudo rpi-update sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get dist-upgrade Install some dependencies : sudo apt-get install git autoconf libtool make pkg-config libusb-1.0-0 libusb-1.0-0-dev telnet sshfs Openocd installation \u00b6 Clone openocd repository and compile: git clone git://git.code.sf.net/p/openocd/code openocd-code cd openocd-code ./bootstrap ./configure --enable-sysfsgpio --enable-bcm2835gpio make sudo make install The list of interfaces that openOCD can use is under: /usr/local/share/openocd/scripts/interface . In order to use the SWD connector that the SCK features, by using Bit Banging , we connect it directly to the Raspberry Pi GPIOs: Running OpenOCD on the raspberry pi \u00b6 Once you are logged into the raspberry Pi you need a openOCD config file to start (ej. sck.cfg ) with this content: source [find interface/raspberrypi2-native.cfg] transport select swd set CHIPNAME at91samd21g18 source [find target/at91samdXX.cfg] adapter_nsrst_delay 100 adapter_nsrst_assert_width 100 init targets reset halt You can store this file in OpenOCD scripts dir so it will auto find it sudo mv sck.cfg /usr/local/share/openocd/scripts/ and then run the OpenOCD server with: sudo openocd -f sck.cfg Then you can connect to OpenOCD, if you want to connect from an external computer, replace 127.0.0.1 with your Raspberry Pi IP address. telnet 127.0.0.1 4444 Example On a arduino zero go to the directory where the *.cfg is and: openocd -f arduino_zero.cfg Open On-Chip Debugger 0.10.0 Licensed under GNU GPL v2 For bug reports, read http://openocd.org/doc/doxygen/bugs.html Info : auto-selecting first available session transport \"swd\".

To do this you can mount your working directory remotely on the Raspberry Pi via SSH: ssh pi@raspi_address pi$ mkdir working_dir pi$ sshfs user@computer_address:working_path working_dir pi$ cd working_dir pi$ sudo openocd -f sck.cfg Then you can connect to OpenOCD from your computer with: telnet raspi_address 4444 Uploading Arduino original bootloader \u00b6 Get the bootloader file here and build it. Connect to OpenOCD server and run: reset halt at91samd bootloader 0 at91samd chip-erase program samd21_sam_ba.bin verify at91samd bootloader 8192 reset run If you don't see any error youre done! Uploading SCK Firmware \u00b6 Install platformio, download and build SCK firmware Connect to OpenOCD server and run: reset halt flash write_image firmware.bin 8192 verify_image firmware.bin 8192 reset run reset run GDB \u00b6 General description \u00b6 The purpose of a debugger such as GDB is to allow you to see what is going on \u201cinside\u201d another program while it executes\u2014or what another program was doing at the moment it crashed. GDB can do four main kinds of things (plus other things in support of these) to help you catch bugs in the act: * Start your program, specifying anything that might affect its behavior. * Make your program stop on specified conditions. * Examine what has happened, when your program has stopped. * Change things in your program, so you can experiment with correcting the effects of one bug and go on to learn about another. Debugging session with Raspberry Pi as the OpenOCD server \u00b6 Once your raspberry pi is setup with above instructions you can just do: ssh pi@RaspberryAddress sudo openocd -f sck.cfg & cd /platformio_project/path arm-none-eabi-gdb ./pioenvs/zeroUSB/firmware.elf (gdb) target remote RaspberryAddress:3333 (gdb) monitor reset run If you are using platformio , you need to modify the compiling option to avoid optimisation with -0g message to the compiler. In case you are not using platformio , activate verbose compiling output at Arduino IDE and find your compiled .elf directory. [env:zeroUSB] platform = atmelsam board = zeroUSB framework = arduino build_flags = -Og Now we are all set and ready to go. The debugger is waiting for instructions on the execution, which we detail below. Info Quick handy instructions inside GDB environment 1. (gdb) appears in every line and you don't have to type it each time 2. In case you need to exit GDB, just type in quit , but remember always killing the process before, should you have a target running (gdb) kill (gdb) quit 3. RET repeats the previous command GDB commands \u00b6 All commands in gdb during debugging are detailed in the GDB guide, chapter GDB commands in detail (continue and stepping) An extract of some useful commands are detailed below: Continuing and stepping \u00b6 continue [ignore-count] Resumes program execution until next breakpoint. [ignore-count] argument allows to specify a further number of times to ingore a breakpoint. (gdb) continue Continuing. Breakpoint 1, tick () at src/HOLA.cpp:9 9 void tick() { step count Continues running your program until control reaches a different source line , only availabe for source lines and functions compiled with debugging information. count is optional and states the number of steps to be performed before stopping, if no breakpoint arrives earlier. next [count] Continue to the next source line without going into functions . It has the same functionality as step, but it stays in the same stack frame. count works as in step count . As well, it understands jumps calls as in the end of for loops and return to the beginning of the loop. Info set step-mode on/off sets the behaviour of (gdb) when stepping into a function with no debugging information. In the case of step-mode on , it inspects the first line of code of the function, whereas on step-mode off it skips the function completely. finish Continue running until just after function in the selected stack frame returns . until Has the same behaviour as step , but it ignores the jumps between lines due to loops (for, whiles, etc), continuing to the next source code with incremental line number. Breakpoints \u00b6 info breakpoints Retrieve information about breakpoints (gdb) info breakpoints Num Type Disp Enb ress What 1 breakpoint keep y 0x00002140 in tick() at src/HOLA.cpp:9 breakpoint already hit 15 times break Set a breakpoint in a specific function (gdb) break loop Set a breakpoint in a specific line (344) (gdb) break main.cpp:344 Info Use the tbreak command instead of break if you want to stop the program once, and then remove the breakpoint. More breakpoint condition options can be found here you can find watchpoint Set a watchpoint watchpoint to only stop once a variable has a certain value. (gdb) watch timer Info Type in info watchpoints to get information about watchpoints. commands Set a list of actions related to the breakpoint: break main.cpp:50 commands silent printf \"count is %d\\n\",count cont end delete Delete a breakpoint (gdb) delete 1 (gdb) info breakpoints No breakpoints or watchpoints. Printing / setting variables and more \u00b6 loop Read what is around a certain function (gdb) l loop 25 //while (!Serial) { 26 //; // wait for serial port to connect. Needed for native USB port only 27 //} 28 } 29 30 void loop() { 31 // put your main code here, to run repeatedly: 32 Serial.println(\"HOLA\"); 33 tick(); 34 Serial.println(millis()); print Retrieve value of a specific variable (gdb) print timer $12 = 2 set Set variable to a certain value (gdb) set timer = 0 Target commands (load) \u00b6 load filename offset Load it is meant to make filename (an executable) available for debugging on the remote system\u2014by downloading it. load also records the filename symbol table in GDB, like the add-symbol-file command. The file is loaded at whatever address is specified in the executable, also into flash memory. Making changes in the code \u00b6 Anytime we make a change in the code, we don't need to reload the debugging session. We can easily do so by: Compile the code: a. Define Shell build in Sublime Text and configure a build sytem with: \"shell_cmd\": \"cd .. && pio run\" Then, everytime you hit Ctrl+B (Cmd+B) and you use your custom build system, it will automatically use this option. b. Or hit pio run in another terminal located in your project root directory In gdb, load file. This will reload the file defined at the beginning of your debugging session and upload it to the target (gdb) load Loading section .text, size 0x2e50 lma 0x2000 Loading section .ramfunc, size 0x60 lma 0x4e50 Loading section .data, size 0x110 lma 0x4eb0 Start address 0x2910, load size 12224 Transfer rate: 3 KB/sec, 4074 bytes/write. Keep debugging GDB Console \u00b6 TUI \u00b6 GDB has a console GUI option available with the command line option --tui In the upper frame you can see the code that's being executed. GDB init file \u00b6 From this example dashboard we can generate a custom .gdbinit file for the SCK which will be placed in the HOME directory... (ON GOING) Info Would be interesting to generate a custom option for production validation and one for internal debugging purposes For references about where to locate the .gdbinit and more custom behaviour for gdb in general see here .

For communications the SCK has an ESP8266 microcontroler with Wifi capabilities , this chip receives instructions from the SAMD21 via serial port and takes care of publishing the collected data through the network and takes care of serving the web pages for the setup mode configuration server. Prerequisites \u00b6 Getting the firmware \u00b6 The Smart Citizen Kit Firmware is on our repository on github so you will need git software installed . Danger Do not install anything until reading completely this guide. Specially for Windows users, it can be particularly painful and we don't guarantee everything is going to work. Drop us an email at support if you need help. Building the firmware \u00b6 To build the SmartCitizen Kit firmware you need a computer with platformio installed. You don't need the full IDE installation (Atom or VSCode). You can follow this instructions to install only the console version. See below if you don't have python yet (or you don't know it's ok). Advanced For bootloader upload you also need OpenOCD somewhere in your PATH (more advanced). Installing Python \u00b6 Platformio is written in python , and this guide makes use of a lot of python scripts. You need to have at least python=3.6 installed. If not, follow this guide . This guide will asume you use either python , python3 for running scripts, or pip and pip3 for installing things, we will just detail instructions run by python and packages installed by pip , but you should know what it's installed on your computer. Windows users We recommend: Using PowerShell (with admin rights ) Installing Chocolatey and then proceeding with: choco install python Read very carefully the output of the installation . You can check if you have python installed: > which python /usr/bin/python Windows To do this in Windows , you can check the output of python --version Install pip if you don't have it (check pip before): > curl https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py -o get-pip.py > python get-pip.py Install pyserial : > pip install pyserial Once this is running, you can do either of the ones below. We will use the generic one throughout the guide: Windows/linux/macOS > cd smartcitizen-kit-21 > python make.py -h linux/macOS > cd smartcitizen-kit-21 > ./make.py -h Getting the firmware \u00b6 To get the firmware just run: > git clone --recursive https://github.com/fablabbcn/smartcitizen-kit-21 The bootloader and tools repositories are submodules of the main firmware so you must do a --recursive clone to get them. Info If you download the code manually (with the clone or download button on github) you will not get the bootloader and tools submodules code. To be able to compile the firmware you need to download the tools submodule and place it in the proper folder. Getting latest changes \u00b6 If you want to update firmware, you can do so since the repository is connected with our Github repository via git . You can do so by: cd smartcitizen-kit-21 git pull ... cd tools git pull origin master ... Or simply: cd smartcitizen-kit-21 git pull --recurse-submodules ... SAMD21 bootloader \u00b6 Make sure you need to do this This instructions only are needed if your kit doesn't have the bootloader already flashed. If you don't know what you are doing here, skip to the flashing section . If your kit doesn't have the bootloader already flashed (all the kits that we ship come with it) you will need an ATMEL-ICE programmer. This process can also be done with a Raspberry Pi computer and the proper connector and cables, in this guide you will find information on how to do this. Connect the Atmel-ICE programmer to the 10 pin SWD connector and to your computer. Power the SCK via USB, you can use any USB charger or even your computer. Open a terminal, go to the folder where you cloned the firmware repository and run: > cd smartcitizen-kit-21 > ./make.py boot You will see a lot of output when compiling, the led on the SCK should breath in green and you should see an output similar to this: You are ready for the next step, just remember to disconnect the Atmel-ICE programmer and connect the SCK to your computer with a USB cable. SAMD21 firmware \u00b6 The bootloader we just flashed allows a very simple way of uploading the SCK firmware based on the UF2 format, when you double-click the reset button of your kit it will expose a MSD interface to your computer and a new drive will popup where you can just drag the compiled firmware file (converted to UF2 format). Build script \u00b6 > python make.py You need to specify at least one action!!! USAGE: build.py [options] action[s] target[s] -p port -f options: -v: verbose -k: keep configuration actions: boot (only for sam), build, flash targets: sam, esp [-p port [-f]] -p port [-f]: specify a port instead of scanning -f: option ignores serial device description (must contain Smartcitizen otherwise) You can use the same script used to flash the bootloader ( make.py ) that will do everything for you: compile the firmware, convert the binary to UF2 format and upload it to the kit: > python make.py build flash sam -v You can make each action separate: Build SAMD21 > python make.py build sam -v Flash SAMD21 > python make.py flash sam -v Both > python make.py build flash sam -v SCK not found In some platforms, the SCK doesn't show up as \"Smartcitizen\" in the USB Device Description. This might make the script to fail and not detect it. This can be bypassed by specifying the port in which the SCK is connected. To find out which port it is, check here . Then, run the command below, where is to be replaced: > python make.py flash sam -p <PORT> -v If this is your first time building the software, platformio will take a while installing all the needed dependencies, be patient. If there are no errors you should see an output similar to this: > python make.py build flash sam [0] Smartcitizen Kit S/N: 6E9FE7335150364852202020FF180E30 Building SAM firmware... OK Flashing SAM firmware... OK A copy of the compiled software in UF2 format called SAM_firmware.uf2 will remain in the bin folder. You can use this file to reflash your kit without compiling it again. Info If you have any problem you can enable verbose output by calling build.py script with the -v flag. There is a known issue that causes first compilation to fail, if this happens please just try again. Manual process \u00b6 If you want to install the firmware manually (or you had some problem with the build script) just follow this steps: > cd sam > pio run After a lot of compilation messages you should see an output similar to this: Indexing .pio/build/sck2/libFrameworkArduino.a Linking .pio/build/sck2/firmware.elf Checking size .pio/build/sck2/firmware.elf Building .pio/build/sck2/firmware.bin Advanced Memory Usage is available via \"PlatformIO Home > Project Inspect\" RAM: [======= ] 73.3% (used 24004 bytes from 32768 bytes) Flash: [======== ] 80.7% (used 211548 bytes from 262144 bytes) ====================== [SUCCESS] Took 43.41 seconds ====================== then to convert the binary firmware to UF2 format do: > cd .. > ./tools/uf2conv.py -o SAM_firmware.uf2 sam/.pio/build/sck2/firmware.bin And you should see something like this: Converting to uf2, output size: 423424, start address: 0x2000 Wrote 423424 bytes to SAM_firmware.uf2. Now double-click the reset button of your kit open your favorite file browser and drag the file you just created to the SCK-2.0 drive. The kit will reset and run the new firmware. Info Keep in mind that if your computer is not configured to automount new drives you will need to mount your sck manually ( as any other USB drive ). ESP8266 firmware \u00b6 Just like the other parts of the process this is also covered by our make.py script. So you can just do: Build ESP > python make.py build esp -v Flash ESP > python make.py flash esp -v Both > python make.py build flash esp -v As before, if this is the first time you do it, it will take a while on downloading dependecies and building the firmware. In this case the upload process is different, since the ESP8266 chip is not connected to the USB interface the data must be uploadded through the SAMD21 chip. Our upload script takes care of searching for a SCK on the USB bus, sending a command to the kit so it put's himself in what we call bridge mode (white led) and uploading the firmware. This is the expected output: > python make.py build flash esp [0] Smartcitizen Kit S/N: 6E9FE7335150364852202020FF180E30 Building ESP firmware... OK Flashing ESP firmware... OK Warning Sometimes the ESP8266 and the uploader software don't get synced and the upload fails. Normally if you try again it will work. After first try you don't need to rebuild, you can just do python make.py flash esp . Manual update \u00b6 You can perform a manual update if you only want or can have a small python installation. Another option is possible if you have platformio and you want to use esptool binaries. Using esptool.py \u00b6 Preparation \u00b6 Get esptool.py : > wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fablabbcn/smartcitizen-tools/master/esptool.py Get the latest firmware from https://github.com/fablabbcn/smartcitizen-kit-21/releases or ask us at support Flashing \u00b6 Get your usb-port id (check here ): Put the SAM in bridge mode (replace <PORT> with the portname from above). > echo 'esp -flash 115200' > <PORT> echo not working? You can do the same in the Arduino IDE, using the Serial Monitor and writing esp -flash 115200 . Remember to close the Serial Monitor window after it. Now you should see the SCK's LED in WHITE. Flash the esp using esptool.py from before. Make sure the ESP_firmware.bin is also there (replace <PORT> ): > python esptool.py --port <PORT> --baud 115200 write_flash 0x000000 ESP_firmware.bin Using esptool binaries \u00b6 Locate esptool binaries: > cd smartcitizen-kit-21/sam > pio run -t envdump ... Find PROJECT_PACKAGES_DIR in the output and navigate to (replace <PROJECT_PACKAGES_DIR> ): > cd <PROJECT_PACKAGES_DIR>/tool-esptool > ls ... There you should find a binary file for esptool . Now you should be able to run (replace <PROJECT_PACKAGES_DIR> and <PORT> ): > cd smartcitizen-kit-21 > echo 'esp -flash 115200' > <PORT> > <PROJECT_PACKAGES_DIR>/tool-esptool/esptool -cp <PORT> -cb 115200 -ca 0x000000 -cf bin/ESP_firmware.bin Remember you can put the SAMD21 in bridge mode (white LED) by using Arduino IDE, sending esp -flash 115200 using the Serial Monitor and then closing the Serial Monitor window. Finding the port \u00b6 For Windows, open the device manager and find the SCK in Ports (COM & LPT) . Use that port (normally COM... ). For macOS and linux, normally /dev/* : macOS > ls /dev/* | grep usb linux > ls /dev/* | grep tty","title":"Edit the firmware"},{"location":"Guides/firmware/Edit%20the%20Firmware/#prerequisites","text":"","title":"Prerequisites"},{"location":"Guides/firmware/Edit%20the%20Firmware/#getting-the-firmware","text":"The Smart Citizen Kit Firmware is on our repository on github so you will need git software installed .

What are third party sensors ? By third party sensors, we mean sensors that have been developed by others, with no affiliation to the Smart Citizen Team. This page is a digest and updated version of the Making Sense D2.3 Smart Citizen Toolkit report and Making Sense D.24 Smart Citizen Toolkit report updates . Both these reports reflect information for the SCK 1.5 , which is not a commercially available version of the kit. This guide is an update version for the SCK 2.1. Use of already supported sensors \u00b6 The auxiliary port is designed to expand the sensor board by adding new sensors via the common I2C standard. However other protocols are supported, such as SPI or UART. The pins have the following default configuration: PIN PORT Function 1 SCL I2C (by software: 1-WIRE or other) 2 SDA I2C (by software: 1-WIRE or other) 3 VCC Voltage 4 GND Ground By connecting any of the supported sensors to the SCK, it will automatically be detected and data will be logged into the SD-card. You can check the output of the sensor command in the Serial output : > sensor Enabled ---------- Temperature (60 sec) Humidity (60 sec) Ext Temperature (60 sec) Ext Humidity (60 sec) Battery (60 sec) Light (60 sec) Noise dBA (60 sec) Barometric pressure (60 sec) PM 1.0 (60 sec) PM 2.5 (60 sec) PM 10.0 (60 sec) Publishing data using custom devices \u00b6 The Smart Citizen Platform supports data from any sensor that has a numerical digital output . The Smart Citizen API supports other devices to publish data to the platform by previously agreeing with the Smart Citizen terms and conditions. For each device type, a new device blueprint needs to be created. A device blueprint defines the sensors and the metrics that your devices will have. This will include the hardware details of your sensors and the kind of data that will be published to the platform. Custom calibration formulas to be applied to the data when processed in the platform can be also added. How to do it? Once a device blueprint is added to the platform, any user can create as many devices as needed and publish data to them following the standard Smart Citizen API. It is important to note that Device Blueprint currently cannot be created by users and should be requested by contacting support@smartcitizen.me . The minimal Device Blueprint includes all the necessary data that a user might provide in order to create a Kit . It is composed of Components and those can reuse existing Sensors and Measurements definitions. Sensors define the hardware or software component that records the data. Measurements are descriptions of what sensors are recording.

The Smart Citizen API supports other devices to publish data to the platform by previously agreeing with the Smart Citizen terms and conditions. For each device type, a new device blueprint needs to be created. A device blueprint defines the sensors and the metrics that your devices will have. This will include the hardware details of your sensors and the kind of data that will be published to the platform. Custom calibration formulas to be applied to the data when processed in the platform can be also added. How to do it? Once a device blueprint is added to the platform, any user can create as many devices as needed and publish data to them following the standard Smart Citizen API. It is important to note that Device Blueprint currently cannot be created by users and should be requested by contacting support@smartcitizen.me . The minimal Device Blueprint includes all the necessary data that a user might provide in order to create a Kit . It is composed of Components and those can reuse existing Sensors and Measurements definitions. Sensors define the hardware or software component that records the data. Measurements are descriptions of what sensors are recording. Blueprints can be shared across many devices or can be tailored per device in order to provide dedicated calibration formulas per individual sensor. This is achieved with the Components binding.

In this guide, we will cover how to access to this functionality in different platforms, and some examples. What is it? \u00b6 We could define the shell as a text-based interface to access almost any SCK functionality. In terms of hardware, it relies on the serial communication between the SCK and your computer, so any decent USB cable connected between them will do. How to access it? \u00b6 Software-wise, different platforms will have different interfaces. The easiest and most reliable for all of them would be through the Arduino IDE . Using the Arduino IDE Launch the Arduino IDE and select the port under Tools > Port > : Launch the Serial Monitor under Tools > Serial Monitor . Make sure that the dropdowns in the bottom are set as in the image below ( Carriage return and 115200 baud ) Type in help to get started. More advanced users would probably rather use a more rugged interface. In this case, you could use screen in your terminal of choice: > ls /dev/cu | grep usb cu.usbmodem1411 tty.usbmodem1411 > screen /dev/cu.usmodem1411 SCK > ... If you already installed platformio to edit the firmware you can use it here, too > pio device monitor SCK > ... Be patient! The port will take a little time to appear in your list of devices. Normally the LED of your SCK will be static white during that period. Some examples! \u00b6 The help command outputs a quite intuitive explanation of all the commands: SCK > help reset: Resets the SCK version: Shows versions and Hardware ID rcause: Show last reset cause (debug) outlevel: Shows/sets output level: outlevel [0:silent, 1:normal, 2:verbose] help: Duhhhh!! pinmux: Shows SAMD pin mapping status sensor: Shows/sets sensor state or interval: sensor sensor-name [-enable or -disable] or [-interval interval(seconds)] read: Reads sensor: read [sensorName] control: Control sensor: control [sensorName] [command] monitor: Continously read sensor: monitor [-sd] [-notime] [-noms] [sensorName[,sensorNameN]] saved: Shows locally stored sensor readings: saved [-details] [-publish] free: Shows the amount of free RAM memory i2c: Search the I2C bus for devices power: Controls/shows power config: power [-info (extra info)] [-batcap mAh] [-otg on/off] [-charge on/off] [-sleep min (0-disable)] config: Shows/sets configuration: config [-defaults] [-mode sdcard/network] [-pubint seconds] [-readint seconds] [-wifi \"ssid\" [\"pass\"]] [-token token] esp: Controls or shows info from ESP: esp [-on -off -sleep -wake -reboot -flash] netinfo: Shows network information time: Shows/sets date and time: time [epoch time] [-sync] state: Shows state flags hello: Sends MQTT hello to platform debug: Toggle debug messages: debug [-sdcard] [-espcom] [-list] shell: Shows or sets shell mode: shell [-on] [-off] mqtt: Publish custom mqtt message: mqtt [\"topic\" \"message\"] Pro tip The SCK outputs a lot of information via serial. This can be sometimes confusing while typing commands. You can silent it a bit with this command: SCK > shell -on Shell mode: on This will turn your LED static yellow, and no output except responses to your commands will be given. Remember to turn it off after you are done experimenting! SCK > shell -off Shell mode: off Set the recording configuration \u00b6 If you want to change your recording mode to, for instance, sdcard mode, you could do so by typing: SCK > config -mode sdcard To set it up in network mode: SCK > config -mode network -wifi \"SSID\" \"PASSWORD\" -token 123456 Warning Note that the token is not between quotes since it's always 6 digits To modify your wifi: SCK > config -wifi \"NEWSSID\" \"NEWPASSWORD\" You can check your current configuration by typing config : SCK > config Mode: sdcard Publish interval: 60 Reading interval: 60 Wifi credentials: not configured Token: not configured Mac address: 11:22:33:44:55:66 Set recording and publication intervals \u00b6 In order to understand the reading and publication intervals, it is important to describe how the structure of the measurements is done: Overall reading interval : base period for the SCK to take a measurement Individual sensor reading interval : period for each sensor to take a measurement. It is defined as N times the Overall reading interval Publication interval : time for the SCK to publish to the Smart Citizen Platform, independent of the reading interval. Each of the sensors can be configured independently, with a reading interval N times the overall reading interval . For instance, after the SAM firmware V0.9.7 , all the sensors are read every 60s except the PMS5003, which is read every 5 minutes or 5 times the reading interval. In the case of the publication interval to the Smart Citizen Platform, the default is 3 minutes. Battery calculator This configuration option is very interesting to be used for battery saving. Make sure you check the battery calculator All this can be configured using the shell interface. For instance, to set the publication interval to every 10 minutes, we could do: config -pubint 600 Or to set the reading interval to every 3 minutes: config -readint 180 Or both at 10 minutes: config -pubint 600 -readint 600 If we want to configure one specific sensor, we can do so by typing the following, only remember, that it's rounded to the closest integer multiplier of the overall reading interval : SCK > sensor temp -interval 360 The sensor read interval is calculated as a multiple of general read interval (180) Changing interval of Temperature to 360 Saved configuration on eeprom!! For instance, if we try to do 1.5 times the reading interval of the temperature sensor, we will get: SCK > sensor temp -interval 240 The sensor read interval is calculated as a multiple of general read interval (180) Changing interval of Temperature to 180 Saved configuration on eeprom!! Some limitations apply though: The minimum reading and publish interval is 5s The maximum reading interval is one hour The maximum publish interval is one hour For more customisation, please email or post on the forum . Default configuration At the moment there is no command to return to the default configuration. You should use: config -pubint 300 -readint 60 ... sensor pm -interval 300 Get version data \u00b6 Check your hardware and firmware version data with the command version : SCK > version Hardware Version: 2.1 SAM Hardware ID: 5934C4B550515157382E3120FF151210 SAM version: 0.9.1-30e1776 SAM build date: 2019-05-07T02:45:29Z ESP MAC address: 86:0D:8E:A7:7F:CC ESP version: not synced ESP build date: not synced List/modify the active sensors \u00b6 By typing in sensor , a list of enabled and supported sensors is displayed: SCK > sensor Disabled ---------- PM board Dallas Temperature [...] Enabled ---------- Temperature (60 sec) Humidity (60 sec) Battery (60 sec) Light (60 sec) Noise dBA (60 sec) Barometric pressure (60 sec) VOC Gas CCS811 (60 sec) eCO2 Gas CCS811 (60 sec) PM 1.0 (60 sec) PM 2.5 (60 sec) PM 10.0 (60 sec) To disable one sensor, you can type in part of the sensor name: SCK > sensor -disable Noise Disabling Noise dBA Saved configuration on eeprom!!

This can be useful in case you want to log data as fast as possible, with little delay between readings (~100ms). Advanced (but cool) example! \u00b6 Making most of the digital microphone The digital microphone in your SCK uses an FFT algorithm to calculate the final sound pressure level (SPL) in different scales (A, C, Z). The FFT spectrum is also available for user analysis. Let's have a look! First, enable it with: SCK > sensor -enable fft Enabling Noise FFT Then, monitor and log it in a file with: echo \"monitor fft\" > /dev/cu.usbmodem1411 && screen -L /dev/cu.usbmodem1411 In this file, we will have something like: 12 15 19 20 0 ... 12 23 2019-07-11T09:30:01Z 5 null ... The values between the dates are the actual FFT spectrum. We will now clean the lines with the dates and then plot the data. For this, we will use a python code to make things easier. You can download the code here . If we run this code in python3 in the same folder where the screenlog from before is: > python spectrum_example.py We will have two outputs: a csv file with the spectrums in rows, and a png image that looks like this!

It is defined as N times the Overall reading interval Publication interval : time for the SCK to publish to the Smart Citizen Platform, independent of the reading interval. Each of the sensors can be configured independently, with a reading interval N times the overall reading interval . For instance, after the SAM firmware V0.9.7 , all the sensors are read every 60s except the PMS5003, which is read every 5 minutes or 5 times the reading interval. In the case of the publication interval to the Smart Citizen Platform, the default is 3 minutes. Battery calculator This configuration option is very interesting to be used for battery saving. Make sure you check the battery calculator All this can be configured using the shell interface. For instance, to set the publication interval to every 10 minutes, we could do: config -pubint 600 Or to set the reading interval to every 3 minutes: config -readint 180 Or both at 10 minutes: config -pubint 600 -readint 600 If we want to configure one specific sensor, we can do so by typing the following, only remember, that it's rounded to the closest integer multiplier of the overall reading interval : SCK > sensor temp -interval 360 The sensor read interval is calculated as a multiple of general read interval (180) Changing interval of Temperature to 360 Saved configuration on eeprom!! For instance, if we try to do 1.5 times the reading interval of the temperature sensor, we will get: SCK > sensor temp -interval 240 The sensor read interval is calculated as a multiple of general read interval (180) Changing interval of Temperature to 180 Saved configuration on eeprom!! Some limitations apply though: The minimum reading and publish interval is 5s The maximum reading interval is one hour The maximum publish interval is one hour For more customisation, please email or post on the forum .

This study uses alphasense's 3-electrode sensors, and here it is further extended to the case of 4-electrode sensors, taking into account the auxiliary electrode. Baseline correction based on temperature \u00b6 The mentioned work described the correction method based on temperature using a baseline correction algorithm which is described in [^2]. This is summarised below: For each day of gas working electrode readings, and for each point in the time series (i), the minimum value of the working electrode value that is contained within the interval (i- \\delta \\delta < i < i+ \\delta \\delta ) is determined, where \\delta \\delta is an interval ranging from 0 to a day length. The outcome of this procedure is an array where each column is a vector of minimum working electrode values calculated for each \\delta_i \\delta_i value (this is, from now on, baseline_{\\delta_i} baseline_{\\delta_i} ). The correlation between each baseline_{\\delta_i} baseline_{\\delta_i} and the temperature is calculated. Relative humidity is not considered in this study since it's generaly inversely correlated with the temperature. The correlation coefficients for each correlation ( R^2_{\\delta_i} R^2_{\\delta_i} ) are calculated. The maximum R^2 R^2 whith this array is obtained. For the equation at which the maximum R^2_{\\delta_i} R^2_{\\delta_i} is found, the temperature reading is used to calculate the corrected baseline. The corrected baseline is substracted from the actual working electrode reading The final pollutant concentration is calculated based on the corrected working electrode reading and the manufacturer's data. The readings are treated in a day-to-day basis in order to avoid non-stationary temperature trends over several days, but still to account for temperature variations within each day. Finally, a background pollutant concentration is assumed from [^3] which is also summarised below for each pollutant. This background concentration is added to the final result. Background concentrations . Source [^3] Application on 4-electrode sensors \u00b6 This algorithm can be used to correct temperature effects on the working electrode based on the temperature in 4-electrode sensors. The results are discussed below for tests validation campaigns performed within the iScape project. These tests are summarized below: University of Bologna : data collected from 23/January to 13/February. The measured pollutants with reference equipments were CO, NO 2 , NO, NOx and O3. Two prototype Smart Citizen Stations were deployed in two different sites, with two Smart Citizen Kits. University College Dublin : data collected from 27/March to 17/April. The measured pollutants with reference equipments were NO, NO 2 and NOX. One prototype Smart Citizen Station was deployed with two Smart Citizen Kits. The results found with this methodology in the reduction sensors (NO 2 , O3) are significant in a daily basis. Two examples of the variation of the correlation coefficient with respect to the delta used to calculate the baseline are shown below: The algorithm is set to apply the best performing correlation function from either a linear or an exponential fit, basing this decission on the one that yields better correlation coefficient. NO 2 and O3 at high concentrations yield better results with an exponential fit, whilst lower concentrations reflect a linear trend: Furthermore, the study from which this methodology is drawn from states that oxidation sensors do not yield a proper baseline correlation methodology and so is validated. The result is indeed far better correlated with the reference measurement if using the manufacturer's methodology: This methodology reads as follows: Concentration \\ [ppm] = {I_{WE}-n(I_{AE}) \\ [nA] \\over Sensitivity \\ [nA/ ppm]} Concentration \\ [ppm] = {I_{WE}-n(I_{AE}) \\ [nA] \\over Sensitivity \\ [nA/ ppm]} Where: I_{WE} (nA) = K (nA/mV) V_{WE} (mV) I_{WE} (nA) = K (nA/mV) V_{WE} (mV) I_{AE} (nA) = K (nA/mV) V_{AE} (mV) I_{AE} (nA) = K (nA/mV) V_{AE} (mV) Where: * I_{PCBWE} I_{PCBWE} and I_{PCBAE} I_{PCBAE} are the electronic offsets for each electrode * n = {I_{0WE} \\over I_{0AE}} n = {I_{0WE} \\over I_{0AE}} , the ratio between alphasense's zero currents * k is a constant convertion factor ( ~ 6.36 in the case of the SCK Gas Pro Board electronics) In the case of NO 2 , the results provided by this baseline correction algorithm yield better results: Both, CO and NO 2 pollutants, using the best method for each calculation, are shown below: Finally, a comparison between the reference measurement results from both methods is detailed below: Manufacturer Method Baseline Method Pollutant RMSE / R2 RMSE / R2 CO (ppm) 0.2-0.3 / 0.3-0.5 >2 / <0.01 NO 2 (ppb) 21-24 / 0.3-0.5 6 - 12 / 0.4 - 0.6 O3 (ppb) 20-40 / 0.1-0.3 4-9 / 0.1 - 0.3 As seen above, the NO 2 correlation with both methods yields significant results for non-corrected signals, whilst the RMSE values are higher in the case of the manufacturer's proposal. Therefore, for this pollutant, the selected methodology will be the baseline method. On the contrary, the CO measurements are highly uncorrelated with the baseline method, whilst the original manufacturer's proposal yields decent results. Finally, the O3 correlation levels are lower than the CO and NO 2 measurements. This is possibly due to the O3 reference measurement equipment used in the Bologna campaing, since it shows an inverse relationship with NO 2 which suggests a biased pollutant calculation in the reference equipment: As well, the results from UCD that are used as a reference for NO 2 , suggest a poor zero/span calibration of the equipment as it yields negative results that could spoil the NO 2 correlation/model errors from those tests: Baseline correction based on auxiliary electrode \u00b6 As seen above, the results from applying this methodology to a low concentration, urban environment measurement with 4-electrode sensors yield significantly correlated results in the case of the reductive sensors. It was also seen that oxidation measurements are significantly correlated with the reference measurements while using the manufacturer's suggested method. However, as detailed in the following section, the use of the auxiliary electrode as the source of the correction yields better results due to: The auxiliary electrode is accounting for both, temperature and absolute humidity. The latter could be discarded if the relative humidity is not considered. Since data is treated in a day to day basis, variations of mean temperatures during different days could provoke significant correlations to be found at different timelapses. This provokes gaps in the prediction during night hours that are reduced by the use of the auxiliary electrode. Finally, it is preferrably to use data contained in a single sensor (such as the auxiliary electrode for the EC sensor) rather than including additional sensors in the algorithm. A comparison between the results using this proposed method and the reference measurement from both test campaigns is seen below: Manufacturer Method Baseline Method With Temperature Baseline Method With Auxiliary Electrode Pollutant RMSE / R2 RMSE / R2 RMSE / R2 CO (ppm) 0.2-0.3 / 0.3-0.5 >2 / <0.1 >2 / <0.01 NO 2 (ppb) 21-24 / 0.3-0.5 6-12/0.1-0.4 6 - 12 / 0.4 - 0.6 O3 (ppb) 20-40 / 0.1-0.3 4-12 / <0.2 4-9 / 0.1 - 0.3","title":"Electrochemical sensors methods"},{"location":"assets/notes/electrochemical%20sensors%20methods/#sensor-calibration","text":"The model described in the following section is based on the findings of [^1].

They will be deployed in several cities among the iScape partners in order to 1. develop models for sensor calibration under different climatic and pollutant exposure conditions and 2. assess data quality. This campaign intends to evaluate the Living Lab Station before it's deployment, and trying to prevent concerns raised about data quality that other low-cost sensor platforms 2 3 4 . This evaluation will focus on the real-world conditions calibration , under wide range of exposure and climatic conditions, rather than developing tests in controlled conditions, as prior studies show discrepancies in the accuracy resulting from evaluation in laboratory conditions, versus that of outdoor conditions 2 5 6 . The tests will be conducted by co-location of at least two stations per site with high-end sensors under the conditions indicated in the test section below. The duration of the tests will be of 2,5 months, with two location changes. This is a compromise between the indications given in 1 for at least 3-months campaign and the availability of high-end sensors for the evaluation. Nevertheless, this campaign intends to cover a range of conditions by the deployment of the Living Lab Station in diverse conditions, not only climatic but also exposure-wise. The location changes will also intend to evaluate how well the sensors are able to adapt to these exposure and climatic changes 10 . The data will be uploaded to the SmartCitizen Platform and will be analysed using the Sensor Analysis Framework .

This test campaign also aims to study this concern, with an evaluation for a cross calibration methodology, in which results from a limited subset of observations are applied to the complete dataset 7 . If successful, this would be set ground for the development of calibration strategies where the sensors are co-located with a high-end sensor and posteriorly deployed for citizen-science activities, or long term monitoring of the iScape Living Labs interventions, where high end sensors might not be available. This co-location could be performed in a recurrent manner, performing sequences of calibration-deployment-calibration, using merging calibrations as suggested in 11 .

Manufacturers provide the baseline resistance calibration values per sensor allowing corrections to be easily applied. Low power consumption The Alphasense EC Sensors were selected to provide a higher linearity, repeatability and resolution with respect to Metal Oxyde sensors found in the Urban Sensor Board. The selection of the sensors was based on the wide variety of literature available on them. Both Penza and EuNetAir Consortium (2014) and Mead et al. (2013) test the NO2A1-A3 against reference instruments, in the laboratory as well as in the field, with well-correlated results. The former concluded that the Data Quality Objective for \"indicative measurements\" (European Parliament and Council of the European Union, 2008) is fulfilled, and the latter report sensitivity in the low ppb region with high linearity. Spinelle et al. tested the Alphasense NO2B4 and O3B4 in a field experiment, with various calibration approaches. Performance evaluation of the same sensors was performed later including a test on a wide range of performance parameters (e.g. response time, calibration function, repeatability, drift, hysteresis effect, and matrix effect) (Spinelle et al. 2017). The experiment found a strong correlation with reference instruments (R 2 > 0.9) and identified some cases with significant hysteresis effect related to humidity. In chamber conditions, the performances of the Alphasense CO-B4 was found to be excellent, with the R 2 values being greater than 0.9 (Castell et al. 2017) (Mead et al. 2013) (Sun et al. 2016). Two field studies reported moderate to excellent R 2 values (0.53--0.97) for the CO-B4 sensor (Castell et al. 2017) (Mead et al. 2013). Finally, some calibration approaches as detailed in Popoola et al. (2016) and Hagan et al. (2018) are used in the post-processing stage as a basis for pollution concentration calculations.","title":"Sensor selection alphasense"},{"location":"assets/notes/sensor-selection-alphasense/#sensors-selection","text":"The following characteristics have been considered for the sensor choice The driver's board designed includes a temperature and humidity sensor for calibrating the temperature dependence of the sensing subsystem.
