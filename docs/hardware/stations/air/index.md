# Smart Citizen Air Quality Stations

The Air Quality (AQ) Station variations expand the [Kit](/hardware/kit/) with more advanced sensors, such as [electrochemical](/knowledge/air/chemical) or [CO2](/knowledge/air/co2) sensors. The units can be adapted to the particular monitoring needs of each case, thanks to their modular approach and _fab-ability_.

## Metrics

Generally, an AQ Station is a [Kit](/hardware/kit) with either [CO2](/knowledge/air/co2) or another [chemical composition](/knowledge/air/chemical) sensor. You can also measure with other _analog_ sensors (besides the electrochemical ones, **up to 16 analog channels** in total!), with a couple of [Analog Sensor Boards](/hardware/boards/analog-sensor-board/).

| Metric | Usage | Sensor | Interface Board | Calibration |
| :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |
| Temperature and RH | Environmental Parameters | [Sensirion SHT3X](/knowledge/air/temperature_rel_humidity/Sensirion_SHT3X) | [Data board](/hardware/boards/data-board) | See [SHT31 page](/knowledge/air/temperature_rel_humidity/Sensirion_SHT3X#calibration)  |
| CO2 | _Normally_ Indoor AQ | [Sensirion SCD30](/knowledge/air/co2/Sensirion_SCD30) or [Sensirion SCD4X](/knowledge/air/co2/Sensirion_SCD4X) | [Data board](/hardware/boards/data-board)  | See [SCD30 CO2 page](/knowledge/air/co2/Sensirion_SCD30#calibration) |
| PM | AQ | [Plantower PMS5003](/knowledge/air/pm/Plantower_PMS5003),  [Sensirion SEN5X](/knowledge/air/pm/Sensirion_SEN5X) or [Sensirion SPS30](/knowledge/air/pm/Sensirion_SPS30) | [Urban Board](/hardware/boards/urban-board) or [PM Board](/hardware/boards/pm-board) for PMS5003 only. See sensor pages. | See [PM Knowledge page](/knowledge/air/pm/) |
| Chemical | AQ | [Alphasense Electrochemical](/knowledge/air/chemical/Alphasense_Electrochemical), also compatible with other Analog Sensors | [Analog Sensor Board](/hardware/boards/analog-sensor-board) | See [Chemical Composition Knowledge page](/knowledge/air/chemical/) |

!!! info "From the ground up"
    The Station uses the same core functionality, interface, and feedback as the Smart Citizen Kit. Get familiar with it before jumping into the Station!

!!! info "A note about versions"

    The **iScape Living Lab Station 1.0** was the development version for the 2.0 version. It was sponsored thanks to the [iSCAPE project](https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/689954/results) under the European Communityâ€™s H2020 Programme under Grant Agreement No. [689954](https://cordis.europa.eu/project/rcn/202639/en).
