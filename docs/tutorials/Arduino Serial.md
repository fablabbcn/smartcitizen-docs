# Arduino serial monitor with the SCK

This tutorial is useful for testing the data recorded in real time and live demostrations.

`Estimated time:` 15 minutes + 15 minutes if you don't have Arduino IDE installed. 
 
**Requirements**:

* SCK to monitor
* MicroUSB cable.
* A computer where we're going to configure it. 
* Have Arduino IDE installed or other serial monitor installed (or knowledge about using it through terminal). You can download it from [here](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software)

## Connect to your kit

**Connect the MicroUSB cable** to the SCK:

And the USB to your computer:

Open the Arduino IDE (the screenshots are done Arduino 2.0 in Windows). If this is your first time with the Arduino IDE don't worry, we will just be working with a couple of things.

**Set the port** 

Go to `Tools->Port` and  select the port that reads like either: 
- `(Arduino Zero (Native USB Port))`
- `(Arduino/Genuino Zero (Autodetect Port))`

## Open the serial plotter

Go to `Tools->Serial plotter`

    **Check if the USB** is properly connected and then, **revise if the port is properly selected**. Last, **check if there is a board selected**. 

    If the cable is connected but it's not being recognized by the Arduino IDE, try to reset the SCK by the ON/OFF button:

    _ON/OFF button_

!!! info "Arduino IDE 2.x"
    Alternativately, in Arduino IDE 2.x you can select the port from the display on the top

    If you do, you're going to be asked probably to install the specific board of the board that the smartcitizen has on the bottom.

    You can just follow the steps of installing the board (you may have some warnings from Windows of needing permissions).
    
If everything is correct you should get something like this:

## Use commands to select the plotting device

When you open the serial plotter you will have something like this:

It's important to check the bottom part where it should say `Carriage Return` and `115200 baud`:

In the box of `Type Message` we can send message to the kit. 

!!! info "The commands"

    If you want to know more about the available commands you can visit the information about [using the shell](https://docs.smartcitizen.me/Guides/getting%20started/Using%20the%20Shell/#connectivity-or-configuration-issues) or visit the [Shell webinars](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNStSudpg0A&list=PL33KKs9g8Y1IWsTZZmDc-46yFuuIRZEmi&index=5)!

These commands are without timestamp and they are usually seen in "value2". They will change at very high speed!

### Noise

Input this command: 

```
monitor noise -notime -noms
```

You will get something like this.

You will get the data in dBA. You can try to clap or stay quiet to keep the noise levels low. 

### Light

Input this command: 

```
monitor light -notime -noms
```

You will get something like this. 

![](https://i.imgur.com/x2Jzfyx.png)

Output is in lux. By covering or pointing the sensor to a light source you should see some changes.

### Temperature

Input this command: 

```
monitor temp -notime -noms
```

You will get something like this:

![](https://i.imgur.com/w2OpzDg.png)

The output will be in ÂºC. You can put your finger into the temp and humidity sensor to see how it changes over time and go back to normal. 

### Humidity

Input this command: 

```
monitor humidity -notime -noms
```

You will get something like this. 

![](https://i.imgur.com/wHtkknW.png)

The output is in %RH. You can put your finger into the temp and humidity sensor to see how it changes over time and go back to normal. 

### Pressure

Input this command: 

```
monitor pressure -notime -noms
```

You will get something like this. 

![](https://i.imgur.com/EcNKmZm.png)

The output is in kPa.

### VOC Gas CCS811

Input this command: 

```
monitor VOC -notime -noms
```

### eCO2 Gas CCS811

Input this command: 

```
monitor eCO2 -notime -noms
```

### PM 1.0

Input this command: 

```
monitor pm -notime -noms
```

### PM 2.5

Input this command: 

```
monitor PM 2.5 -notime -noms
```

### PM 10.0

Input this command: 

```
monitor PM 10 -notime -noms
```
