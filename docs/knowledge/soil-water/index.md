# Soil and water measurements

*Water measurements** are a bit more complex than those in air, at least for _lower-cost sensors_. Here, we are generally limited to physico-chemical parameters such as pH, conductivity, dissolved oxygen and similar. Similar to [air measurements](../air/index), when the data board by itself can't read the sensor directly, we need to use _interface electronics_ to get reading from them.
