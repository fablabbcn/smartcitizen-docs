# Knowledge

In this section, you will find a compilation of the different environmental variables, and the sensors used to monitor them, available in the Smart Citizen Kit. Feel free to contribute!

## Onboard Sensors

Below, you will find the sensors that are included by _default_ in any of the Smart Citizen Kit versions (2.1, 2.2 or 2.3).

## Auxiliary Connector

This is a list of supported sensors and other components that you can connect directly to the **auxiliary port**. The links provided below are for breakout boards by some other open hardware provided such as [Sparkfun](https://sparkfun.com), [Adafruit](https://adafruit.com) or [Seeed Studio](https://seeedstudio.com). However, any other format or breakout board would work.
