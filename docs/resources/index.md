<!-- TODO - Tidy Up! -->

The Smart Citizen project has had the chance to be part of fantastic projects throughout it's (brief) history. Ranging from public interventions in urban areas to the development of DIY sensors for agriculture, the team has carried out an enormous efforts to develop a technical platform that supports a wide range of communities on the creation of participatory sensing initiatives. This section is a summary of these projects that might inspire you in future actions. They show the vast amount of possibilities offered by the Smart Citizen tools as key enablers of participatory sensing pilots and experiments.

By providing meaningful examples of novel appropriations and uses we seek to  inspire communities to conduct their own experiments and, hopefully, even their  own custom tools.

!!! info "Check our guides"
    All these projects left us with a great amount of experience and knowledge that we have compiled in this documentation. Find out how to use them in our [guides section](/guides)

## Education

!!! info "School project in Barcelona?"
    You can have a look [here](https://serveiseducatius.xtec.cat/cesire/prestec/sensors-smart-citizen/) to borrow sensors and SCKs for a period of time with activities and other guides included.

Here there is a compilation of projects that we have done around education, directly or indirectly with other partners:
