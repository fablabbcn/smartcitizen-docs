    2. **Connect to the kit** with your mobile device as you did during the installation process. You will need to search for a **Wi-Fi network** called `SmartCitizen[···]`. If you have multiple kits `[···]` is the unique identifier of your kit.
    3. Next, go to http://sck.me on your mobile device and click on the top right corner icon:

!!! tip "Obtain your firmware version remotely (advanced)"

	If you are an advance user managing a big deployment of devices you can obtain remotely the version of all the Kits you have registered by looking at the `hardware_info` property of each of your devices using the platform API `/v0/devices/`. When your Kit is in Wi-Fi mode, it publishes the information daily.
