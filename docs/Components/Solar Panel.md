# Solar Panel

We recommend a Solar Panel from [Voltaic Systems](https://voltaicsystems.com/), either the [6W 6V option](https://voltaicsystems.com/6-watt-panel/) or the [5W 6V version](https://voltaicsystems.com/__socialshop/5-watt-panel-etfe/).

!!! warning "What is this for?"
    Currently, this option is only usable for the Smart Citizen Kit 2.1 with small accessories, like a CO2 sensor or some electrochemical sensors, but it's not suitable for a larger options like the Smart Citizen Station. For this, we recommend a larger solar panel with a lead-acid battery instead as back-up.

We use an [MPTT Sunflower Solar power manager 5V](https://wiki.dfrobot.com/Solar_Power_Manager_5V_SKU__DFR0559) from DF Robot for managing the solar input with an additional 2Ah battery. It is fitted inside the enclosure with a small laser cut (or 3D printed if not available) flange. This is the [BOM](https://github.com/fablabbcn/smartcitizen-enclosures/tree/master/SmartCitizen%20Power%20Options/Solar) for this option.
