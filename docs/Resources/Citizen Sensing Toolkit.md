# Citizen Sensing Toolkit

The [Citizen Sensing Toolkit](http://making-sense.eu/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Citizen-Sensing-A-Toolkit.pdf) was produced as part of the [Making Sense](/European%20Projects/) project, which draws on nine citizen sensing campaigns in Holland, Kosovo and Spain in 2016 and 2017. Based on that experience we developed a framework and methods and tools for citizen participation in environmental monitoring and action. Their approach is bottom-up and participatory, and we call it "citizen sensing".
