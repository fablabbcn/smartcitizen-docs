# Tutorials

Here you have a compilation of **step by step tutorials** on how to use some more extra features of the kit, or to make simple data analysis with [Orange](https://orangedatamining.com/).

### Basic Level

#### Visual programming

!!! info "MECODA Credits"
    This section (in particular the `Orange Widgets`), has been developed and integrated thanks to the work done in [MECODA](https://github.com/eosc-cos4cloud/mecoda-orange) and [cos4cloud](https://cos4cloud.eu/) by the [ICM](https://www.icm.csic.es/es). The initial implementation of widgets connecting to environmental data platforms was done by them, and we only contributed our widget to this fantastic project!

These tutorials will help you go through some basic data analysis tools we like, such as [Orange](https://orangedatamining.com/):

- [Configure Orange Data Analysis](/Resources/Tutorials/Configure%20Orange%20Data%20Analysis/)
- [Smart Citizen Orange Widgets](/Guides/data/Orange%20Data%20Widgets/)
- [Create a simple workflow for data analysis in Orange](/Resources/Tutorials/Simple%20Orange%20Workflow/)
- [Orange and geolocated data](/Resources/Tutorials/Orange%20and%20geolocated%20data/)
- [Averaging and derivating in Orange](/Resources/Tutorials/Averages-and-derivatives-in-Orange/)
