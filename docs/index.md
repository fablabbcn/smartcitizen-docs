This is the **Smart Citizen Project** documentation. In this website you will find all the project's experience and knowledge related to the environmental monitoring tools that it develops. The project touches upon many fields, so we really hope these resources are useful for anyone wanting to learn about what we do: **open hardware, software, sensors knowledge, data, platforms, and much more**.
