    The new [**Smart Citizen Kit**](Smart Citizen Kit) and the [**Smart Citizen Station**](Smart Citizen Station) development was possible thanks to  [iSCAPE](https://www.iscapeproject.eu/), a project under European Community’s H2020 Programme (Grant Agreement No. [689954](https://cordis.europa.eu/project/rcn/202639/en))

## Sections

* **Main:** Contains the [**Smart Citizen Kit**](Smart Citizen Kit) and [**Smart Citizen Station**](Smart Citizen Station) documentation to help you get started. Visit the [Hardware architecture](/Components/) page to understand a bit better how you can better use all the SCK possibilities

* **Data:** Contains all the documentation on data, from collection, storage to analysis and calibration:
    * **Platform:** Contains all the documentation on the [**online platform**](Data/Sensor Platform) where data is collected, stored and visualised
    * **API:** the documentation of our RESTFUL API and how to interact with it
    * **Data Analysis:** Contains all the documentation on the [**data post-processing framework**](Data/Data Analysis) to analyse the sensors data

* **Use cases:** Contains documentation and [**use cases**](/Use Cases/) examples how to use our tools with your local community.

* **Guides:** Contains step-by-step [**guides**](/Guides/) for different features of the kit, how to get started, use the shell, or make some more advanced analysis of the sensor readings!

* **Legacy Hardware:** Are you a pioneer of participatory sensing looking for the original SCK 1.0 and SCK 1.1 documentation? Check the [**Legacy Hardware**](/Components/legacy/) section!

## Guides

The documentation contains multiple [guides](/Guides/) as step-by-step tutorials to perform essential tasks as installing a kit or upgrading it's firmware:
