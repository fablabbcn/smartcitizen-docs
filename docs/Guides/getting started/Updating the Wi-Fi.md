- **Connect to the kit** with your mobile device as you did during the installation process. You will need to search for a **Wi-Fi network** called `SmartCitizen[···]`. If you have multiple kits `[···]` is the unique identifier of your kit.

- Once connected **you should see the Setup App in your phone**. If it doesn't show up automatically you can open http://192.168.1.1 on your phone browser.

- The LED will go blue and **your kit should start to publish again using the new Wi-Fi**. You can confirm it by visiting your device on [smartcitizen.me/kits](https://smartcitizen.me/kits). You can repeat the process as many times as you want by going back to step 1.
