This guide will explain how to assemble the small Smart Citizen Stations. The unit is designed to be manufactured in a Fab Lab, and it has a series of 3D printed components, as well as a rain cover made out of composite material (commercially known as dibond).

## Passing the cable through

Even if it's very simple process, the USB cables we use to power the sensor come in different shapes and sizes. This makes it a bit difficult to seal the enclosure, and the cables are often are pulled and can damage the sensor. To avoid this, make sure you place this small cable gland in the enclosure.

!!! Example "Step-by-step"

	* Prep the white base by dissassembling it from the blue cover

	* Pass the USB Cable through

	* Finish it up with the other half

	* Make sure the amount of cable inside the unit is not too long, not too short!
