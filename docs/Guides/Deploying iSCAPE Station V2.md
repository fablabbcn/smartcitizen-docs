## Instructions

To start the installation simply visit the setup website [stations.iscape.smartcitizen.me](https://stations.iscape.smartcitizen.me).

!!! warning
    We keep track internally of all sensor deployments and it is very important not to swap the internal components between Station to avoid mismatchs on the calibration data.

### Outdoor installation

!!! warning "WIP"
    This section is WIP

## Power

The iSCAPE Station has a battery life of 12 hours as is intended as a backup solution only. That's why a power supply needs to be installed as decribed below. When we no longer want to publish or save more data for a few days we can turn off the kit. To do this, press the button for 5 seconds.

If the colors of the LED appear orange <span class="led small orange"> </span> indicates that the battery must be charged.

The battery takes about 4 hours to fully charge. When the battery is fully charged, change the orange to green <span class="led small green"> </span>.

_Remember that in addition to the colors you will have the state color of the kit: configuration, network and sd._

### Power supply

The Station can be directly powered at 220V AC (max consumption 5W).

!!! warning "Working on batteries"
    The Smart Citizen Station has a higher consumption than the kit, mostly due to the fans on the two PM sensors. That means the internal battery last just for 20h, and it is only aimed at providing backup power.
