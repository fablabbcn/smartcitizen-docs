# A modular tool for citizen action

The guides in this section are aimed at creating a set of tools and resources around the SCK. This allows communities to develop their own sensing frameworks and strategies for participatory sensing. Find here guides that will help with making the best use of the Smart Citizen Kit, from a step-by-step guide on how to [set up your kit](/Guides/getting started/Onboarding Sensors) to more advanced features like [data analysis](/Guides/data/Install the framework/) or using the [SCK's shell](/Guides/getting started/Using the Shell).

## How to get around in the guides?

The guides here are meant to help you with many aspects regarding the sensors and getting specific step-by-step information. Since there are a lot of different guides, here there is a small summary for each type of device:

- [ ] If you haven't started yet to collect data, check the [onboarding sensors](/Guides/getting%20started/Onboarding%20Sensors/) guide
- [ ] If you are about to place the sensor outdoors, check the [deploying Smart Citizen Kit](/Guides/deployments/Deploying%20SCK/) guide
- [ ] Check the [updating the firmware](/Guides/firmware/Update%20the%20firmware/) guide to get the latest version of the firmware in the SCK
- [ ] Moving location? Check the [updating the WiFi](/Guides/getting%20started/Updating%20the%20Wi-Fi/) guide
- [ ] More advanced features? Check the [using the Shell](/Guides/getting%20started/Using%20the%20Shell/) guide

- [ ] If you haven't started yet to collect data, check the [onboarding sensors](/Guides/getting%20started/Onboarding%20Sensors/) guide. In the Stations, you will also need to follow the [handling calibration information](/Guides/data/Handling%20calibration%20data/) guide
- [ ] To place the sensors outdoors, follow the [deploying Smart Citizen Station](/Guides/deployments/Deploying%20Smart%20Citizen%20Station/) guide
- [ ] Similar to the SCK, check the [updating the firmware](/Guides/firmware/Update%20the%20firmware/), [updating the WiFi](/Guides/getting%20started/Updating%20the%20Wi-Fi/) and [using the Shell](/Guides/getting%20started/Using%20the%20Shell/) guides
- [ ] If you have a **CO2 sensor** [Calibration of CO2 sensors](/Guides/calibration/SCD30 CO2 sensor/)
- [ ] If you are working with the data: follow the [data processing](/Guides/data/Custom%20data%20processing/) and [uploading it to Zenodo](/Guides/data/Upload%20data%20to%20zenodo/) guides
- [ ] If you have small stations (with CO2, or two small A-series Electrochemical sensors), check the [assembly of the stations](/Guides/enclosures/Assembling Smart Citizen Stations/) guide

- [ ] [Onboarding sensors](/Guides/getting%20started/Onboarding%20Sensors/)
- [ ] [Deploying Smart Citizen Water Station](/Guides/deployments/Water sensors/)
- [ ] Similar to the SCK, check the [updating the firmware](/Guides/firmware/Update%20the%20firmware/), [updating the WiFi](/Guides/getting%20started/Updating%20the%20Wi-Fi/) and [using the Shell](/Guides/getting%20started/Using%20the%20Shell/) guides
